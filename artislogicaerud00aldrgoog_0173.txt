thought cannot be actually separated from each other, being
merely the same actos thought viewed from opposite sides,
Of objecta out os the act os thought the thinker knows
nothing. But in comparing two minds together, one of
whom is supposed to have a firm conviction of a true pro
position on sufficient grounds, the other an equally firm con·
riction ol a false proposition, the difference between them
will lie, not in the state of conviction which is common to
both, but in the object on which it is exercised3 and the
change from error to knowledge will be effected hythe
substitutiones one object sor another. On the other hand,
is a truth known scientifically by one man is assented to with
hesitation by another, the difference lies in their respective
states os mind in relation to a common object, and the change
from opinion to knowledge will consist in a different mode os
contemplating the same truth. Hence, in strict accuracy‚ we
should say, that the characteristic os error is the attribution
os certainty to a wrong object; that of opinion, the absence
os certainty in the subject. The criterion of knowledge from
error is strictly the character ol the object as it appears to
arightly informed mind; and hence, among the later logicians,
we find respectu objecti used as equivalent to per se: and opposed
to respectu ariperti, as it appears to this particular thinker.
This forms the connecting link between the scholastic use
os olp'ectrm to denote what exista only in thought, and the
modern use, to denote the absolute affectione of things
without the mind.
