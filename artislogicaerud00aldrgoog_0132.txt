Aristotle acknowlcdges only three figures ; looking rather to
the extension ol the middle term, as compared with the other
two, than to its position in the two premises. In this point
of view there are only three figures possible; for the relative
extensione ol the major and minor terms being given, the
middle can only have three positione: between the other
two, as in the first figure; greater than both, as in the
second; or less than both, as in the third. See Trendelen-
burg, Elem. t. 28. Waltz on Anal. Pr. i. 23. 7. The invention
of the fourth figure is attributed by Averroes¹ (on Anal. Pr.
i. 8.) to Galen. The latter may possibly have first called the
five moods by that name, but they were known at a much
earlier period as indireot moods of the first figure. An in·
direct mood is one in which we do not inser the immediate
conclusion, but its converse. Consequently, the predicate
of the conclusion, which in a direct mood is the major term,
is in an indireot one the minor. The five indireot moods
ot' the first figure were called Baralip, Celantes, Dabitis,
Fapesmo, Frisesmo. The three first are clearly Barbara,
(delerent, Darii, with the conclusione converted. With regard
to the two last, the process is alittle more intricate. They
have negative minor premises, and thus offend against a
special rule ol the first figure; but this is ehecked hya
counterbalaneing transgression. For by simply converting
Ο, we alter the distribution of the terme, so as to avoid an
illicit process. Thus,

AllBisA (lap) SomeBisA (sris)
NoOisB (esm) NoOisB (earn)
Therefore SomeA is notO (o) Theresore Some A is notC (ο)

Whero to infer “ Some O is Where to infer “Some G is
not A,” would involve an illicit not Α,” would involve an illicit
process of the major term. process of the major term.

The invention of these indireot moods is attributed to
Theophrastus; not, however, on the authority of Apuleius as
