. The Syllogism inform is an ordinary Cetegorical in the
third ligure3 the Conclusion, however, not being the

original question, but the antecedent of a Hypothetieel
Proposition, of which the question is the consequent0.
The ἀπαγωγὴ εἰς τὸ ἀδύνατον is also Cetegorical, so far as
’ it is Syllogistic. ln this, the conclusion syllogistically
proved is a falseh00d3 the original question being
inserted only by Hypotbesis, because a falsebood results
from tbe assumption of its contradictoryd. The Hypotltesis
in this case is, thet the contradictory is truea Thus, if it
be required to prove that some A is not B, we reason

from the assumption of the contradictory,
All A is B;

All C is A; (συλλογισμὸς ἐξ ὑποθέσεως.)
Therelore, All (l is B.

⁰ Ἐν ὑπασι γὰρ ὑ μὲν συλλογισμδς γίνεται πρδς τδ μεταλαμβανόμενον, τδ δ’
ἐξ ἀρχῆς περαίνεται δι’ ὁμολογίας ll τινος ἄλλης ὑποθέσεως. Auel. Pr. i. 23. ll.
Τδ μεταλαμβανόμενονίε explained by Alexander as applying to the conclusion
oi the syllogism‚ because it is taken in a different manner from that in
which it was originally enunciated3 being at first part cf a conditional
agreement, aud afterwards a categorical conclusion. For this reason, the
syllogismis said to be nard μετάληψιν. Anal. Pr. i. 29. ὑ. Were it not scr
this authority, it would seem simplet to interpret μετάληψις merely “ change
ci question ;'' the disputant turning from the original question tothe proci
os another on which it is supposed to depend. Concerning the other kind
of hypothetical syllogisms mentioned in the same passage, those κατὰ
ποιότητα, we have no data lor even aplausible conjecture. M. St. Hilaire's
explanationis forced. Philopouus, (Scholia, p. 178, b. θ.) says it is a
syllogism, ἐκ τοὺ μᾶλλον, ἣ ἐκ τοὺ ἧττον, ἣ ἐκ τοὺ ὁμοίου, which probably
originated the explanation of Burgersdych, I nst. Lep. ii. 14. “Quo scilicet
probatur quod minus probabile estes conditione, ut probatum sit quod
magis probabile est”

d Anal. Pr. i. 23. 8. Πιίντες γὰρ ci td τοὺ ἀδυνάτου περαίνοντες τδ μὲν
ψεῦδος συλλογίζονται, τδ δ’ ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἐξ ὑποθέσεως δεικνύουσιν ὅταν ἀδύνατόν
τι συμβαίνῃ τῆς ἀντιφάσεως τεθείσης. Ι have substituted a mere symbolical
syllogism sor the instance given by Aristctle, on account of its intricacy,
and the length requisita to expand it. The reader will find it explained
byWaitz, vol. i. p. 430.

θ Anal. Pr. i. 29. 3. Πςίλιν εἰ δεικτικῶς συλλελόγισται τδ Α τῷ Εμηδενὶ
ὑπάρχειν, ὑποθεμένοις ὑπάρχειν τινί διὰ τοῦ ἀδυνάτου δειχθήσεται οὐδενὶ

ὑπάρχον.
