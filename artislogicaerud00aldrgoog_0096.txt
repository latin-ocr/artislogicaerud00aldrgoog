ll, lb.) Nevertheless‚ on the strength of a misunderstood
passage in the De Anima, (i. l, 16.) the threefold division of
real definition has been fathered on the Stagirite. For a
fuller account of Aristotle's doctrine, see Appendix. note Ο.
Before quitting this subject, it may be observed that logicians
have perpetually confounded the thirty or notiora within the
mind with the things or individuale without. Thus, Abp.
Whately observes, that Logia is concerned with nominal

definitions only; because all that is requisite for the purposes ⁴

of reasoning is, that a word shall not be used in different
senaes; a real definition of any thing belongs to the sciense
or system which is employed about that thing. On the
contrary, Logia is concerned with recl or notionoi definitione
only: its object being to produce dhtioctress in concepta, which
arethe things of Logic. Nominat definitions belong to the
grammars or dictionaries of particular languages. Even
Kant (Loyila ᾗ. 106.) has n'ot quite avoided this confusion.

⁰ Metaphysics sive Lopico. On this point the two great
secta of the Schoolmen were at issue. The Ramista, following
the Arabiane, divided Logia into two parts; one, which treated
of the essenos of incomplex notione and things by definitam
the other, of the truth of propositione as determined by
argumentation. To this latter the greater part of the Aristo-
telian Logic was regarded as belonging. The former was
supposed to have formed a lost portion of the ancient science.
The Nominalists, on the other hand, and more correctly‚
maintained that to investigate the essences of things belonged
tothe province of Metaphysics ; the Logician, as such, assigning
no actual definitione, but borrowing them as mere exemplos
from the science to which they properly belong. As autho-
rities for the two ainwa, compare hibent, de Praedicab. Tracti.
