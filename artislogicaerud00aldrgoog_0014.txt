assertion, as to leave him no choice but that of
blind submission to the ipse dicit of his tutor or
the ipse scripsit of his text-book. The same
difficulty meets the editor. In controverting
the positions of a work which for more than a

century and a half has enjoyed the'sanction of
¹ the University, somewhat more of the omecunde
dissentio is becoming than can always be comprised
within the necessary limits of a foot-note. The
further discussion of such points inan Appendix
has in some instances unavoidably produced a
certain amount of repetition. This however, though
injurious to the form of the work, will, it is hoped,
not render it the less serviceable to that not in-
considerable class of students

¹ Compendium have been restored in the present.
This, however, has been done but sparingly. An
account of the Arbor Porphyriones has been trans·
ferred to the first chapter from its original place in
the Penus Logicu. The obvious utility of the

insertion will, it is hoped, warrant the liberty in
’ this single instance taken with the text.

The references to Aristotle have been adapted
to the Oxlord reprint of Bekker's text. In
Germany, a custom seems to be gaining ground
of referring to the peges of the Berlin edition,
but that work has not been sufficiently circulated
