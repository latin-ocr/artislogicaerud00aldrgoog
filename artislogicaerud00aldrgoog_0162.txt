¹ Of the word Dilemma, various etymologias have been
proposed; 1. a choica of alternatives offered to an adversary;
2. a double 'premise assumed (λῆμμα); 3. a not very probable
one given by Keckermann, “a dle λαμβάνεσθαι, quia utrinque
capit et constringit adversarium contra quem adducitur.¹' The
first seems to be adopted by Aldrich, and is perhaps supported
by Cassiodorus, Expos, in Ps. 138, 9. ‘⁶ Dilemma, quod fit ex
duabus propositionibus pluribusve, ex quibus quicquid electum
fuerit, contrarium esse non dubium est.” cl. Victorinus in
1 Rhet. (lic. 86. But whatever be the origin of the word, it
was certainly employed as synonymous with the compleam of
Cicero, (de Inv. 1. 29.) This is expressly stated by Servius,
(on AEn. ii. 6⁷5.) who is, Ι believe, the oldest extant writer in
whom the word is found. In this sense it may be defined,
(omitting the adversany, as belonging rather to Rhetoric or
Dialectic than Logia) “A syllogism, having a conditional
major premise with more than one antecedent, and a dis·
junctive minor.'’ Its different forms may be thus exhibited:

Ι. Simple constructive.

II. complex constructive.
