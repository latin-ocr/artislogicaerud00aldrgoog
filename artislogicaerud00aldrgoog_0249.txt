every attempt at such demonstration necessarily involves
a petitio principii. The reason is obvious: since a
definition cau be predicated essentially (ἐν τῷ vl ἐστι) of
nothing but that of which it is a defiuition 3 and since,
to prove a conclusion concaming the essence, the pre·
misas must be of the same character3 the middle term
assumed must be identical with the minor, and the major
premisc with the conclusion.

Such is Aristotle’s Theory of Definition. Its funda·
mental principle may still, mutatis mutandis, be retained,
notwithstanding that the speculations of modern philo-
sophy hare considerably modified his distinctions of
Substauces and attributes. Properly speaking, indeed,
all Definition is an inquiry into Attrilmtea. Our com·
plex notions of Substances can only be resolved into
various Attributes, with the addition of an unknown
salatratatus-a something to which we are compelled to
regard these Attributes asbelonging1. Man, for example,
is analysed into Animality, Rationality, aud the some·
thing which exhibits these phenomena. Pursue the
analysis‚ and the result is the same. We have a some·
thing corporeal, animated, seusihle, rational. An un·
known constant must always be added to complete the ’
integration; unfortunately we have uc means of de·
termining its value. Still, this does not affect the basis
of the Aristotelian distinction. For some phenomena

others, we must acquiesce in the conviction that they are
so, merely because they are. It is clearly impossible
t'cr the mere hypothesis of an unknown substratum to
explain the reason of all the variety of attributes which
different objects exhibit.

One further question remains. How far Definition
'properly belongs to the province of Logic, was, as we
