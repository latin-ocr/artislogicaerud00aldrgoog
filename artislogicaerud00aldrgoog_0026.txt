the Platonic Dialogues, it is impossible to determine
with any accuracy how much of the doctrines and
methods advocated in those writings is due to the master,
and how much has been added by his disciple. From
the express testimony of Aristotle, however, we may
conclude that Socrates did not, like Plato, maintain the
existence of ideas' separate from the sensible phenomena
of the world¹; and cousequently, that the exaltatiou of
Dialectic from its tentative use to the ranlr of the soience
of absolute being, a view intimately connected with the
ideal theory, is due to Plato rather than to Socrates. Το
Plato also probably belong in a great degree the methods

ol συναγωγὴ aud lanigera, mentioned in the Phaedrus as the
two principal parts of Dialectic, and illustrated at some

length in the Sophistes and the Politicusl. The former
consists in the collection of a number of scattered
objecta in reference to one idea, with a view to definition3
the latter in a gradual dichotomy, by means of contrary
or contradictory members, so as to ascertain as accurately
as possible the number of subordinate species contained
under each genus. lt is the oareful performance of this
process, procoeding gradually through the intermediate
classes to the lowest, that especially distinguishes the
true dialectio method from the eristic¹. These pro·
cesses, for which Plato was perhaps in some degree
indebted to the Eleatic and Megaric Philosophy ¹¹¹, may be ,
regarded as the precursors of the Aristotelian doctrine
of searching for definitione by the two opposite methods‚
afterwards known as those of Division and Inducti0n¹¹.
