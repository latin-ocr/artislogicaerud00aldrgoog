ratione minime distinota; vel in dubiis non reperit quid
statuat, aut etiarn statuit quod falsum est3 vel denique non
servat ordinem in commentando, qui cum natura rerum
consentit. Hisce quatuor malis opponit Logica totidem
remedia. Definitio exhibet menti essentiam rerum: divisio
efficit cognitionem distinctam: syllogismus tollit animi
incertitudinem et errorem circa themata complexa: methodus
ἀταξίαν sive confusionem.” Hence it appears that falsity of
judgment simply was not regarded as remediable by Legio,
but only falsity in relation to the syllogism, i. e. so far as it
depends on the assumed truth or falsity of other judgments.
But the above statement requires considerable limitation.
Every process of thought is liable to a formal defect as
violating its own laws‚ and to amalarici desem, as inconsistent
with experience. Thus aconcept may be obscure or indis-
tinct fonnally, as implying attributes which cannot be thought
in conjunctim, as when its different parts contradict one
another: a judgment may be formally salse, for the sarno
reason: and a reasoning may bc formally inconsequentes
transgressing the laws of the syllogism. In all these cases
the fault may be detected by Logic. On the other hand, a
concept may bc materially obscure or indistinct‚ as containing
attributes which we have never met with in our own expe
rience: ajudgment may be materially false, as being at
varianae with facts: a reasoning may bc materially incon·
sequent, as not warranted by the laws or analogias of nature.
In all these cases, the fault can only be detected and reme-
died by experiente. uf. Prolcyomcac Loqicc, p. 238.
