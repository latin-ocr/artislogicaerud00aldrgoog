naturam sic abstractam, cum sit omni singulorum

singulis diversam, sed ut in omnibus eandem;

given gronp ol individuale resemble each other from those in
which they differ. For this reason Locke calls all universale
obstrnet ideas,¹ a phrase etymologieally allowable, but liable to
be confounded with the scholastic use of the word abstrnct in
a different sense. For this reason it is better to adhere to the
term actionaria which has at the same time the advantage of

leaving the Logieian‚ as such, uncommitted to any metaphysical
hypothesis as to their nature; since the Reclist may interpret
Universal Substoncas, the Nominalist Universal Names, the
Conceptuclist UniversalNotions.

Germalizatioa which some modern writers distinguish from
Abstraction‚ is properlya species of abstraction ; viz. the divest-
ing the presentations of consciuusness os the conditions of
existence in space and time, which are characteristic of indi-
, riduals. This is done by the aid of signs, verbal mother,
which are at first signs of individual objecta, and subsequently
of general notions. Other abstractions may exist without gene-
ralizati0n; but these are not processes of thought, but of per-
ception, intemal or external. Thus, to fix the eye or car on
a particular sight or sonnd exclusirely, is in the widest sense
an obstructiora, but not a gener-alianum. The psychological
controversias concerning abstracticn cannot be discussed
here. See Prolapomeaa Lopica, p. 25.
