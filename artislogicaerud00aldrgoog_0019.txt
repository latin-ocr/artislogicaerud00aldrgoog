ferred to Zeno the Stoic. The division of Philosophy
into Logio, Physica, and Ethics, probably'originated
vvith this Philosopher‘‚ and the use of the name L09ic in
Cicero is principally in relation to the Stoioal doctrinesd.
For the application of the term to the contenta of the
Aristotelian organon, the Greek commentators upon
Aristotle are our earliest extant authority. Alexander
of Aphrodisias, the oldest of these whose works have
come down to us', speaks of ἡ λογικὴ καὶ συλλογιστικὴ
πραγματεία as containing under it ἀποδεικτική, διαλεκτική,

vereamini, and σοφιστική ¹. Here, vvhile Dialectic retains ·

its Aristotelian sense, Loqtc is extended so as to include
the syllogistic theory in general, and its particular appli-
cations to necessary and prohahle matter. A similar
extensiou of Dialectic is found in the commentaries of
David the Armenian⁸; and Philoponus uses both terms
as synonymous, and in the same extent¹.

e Iaert. vii. 39. Plutarch, De Plac. Plu't. i. 1. This division is some-
times attributed to Plato. (ot. Cicero, Queat. dead. i 19. De Fia i. 22.
Enseb. Praep. Ευαιι xi. l. Augustin, De Cic. Det, vina.) But none oi the
three names occur in any cf the extant Platonic vvritings3 and a different
division ot sciences into copritice and praem is intimated by Plato
himself, Polo. p. 258. Indeed the state of philosophy in Platc’s day
would hardly allow cf the Stoical division being made. Cf. Van Heusde,
Initia Phil. Platon. p. 41. 117. Aristotle‘s supposed adoption of the same
threefold classifieationis still more questionable3 being founded on a
misinterpretation of Topica, i. 14. 4. and at variance, as vell vrith the
earliest commentar-y on that passage, as vvith Aristotle's constant use oi
the word λογικός, and with his vell knovvn division cf theoretical Philo·
sophy into Physies, Mathematics, and Theology.

r 'l'he Paraphrase on the Ethies,attributedto hispredeeessor Andronicus

s Scholia, p. 141. a. 19. The testimony cf Boethius (In Pop. Cie.p.⁷dd.)
vvould seem to refer this usage of the word to the elder Peripatefioe, butvve
must reject his reference to Aristotle.
