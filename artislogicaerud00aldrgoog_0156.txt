CAP. IV.
Dc Syllogismis Hypotheticis⁸.

h. l. »syllogismosprotheticcs, est in quo una,
duae, vel tres propositiones hypotheticae. v. g. Si
sopit, est beatus: Sapit ; ergo est beatus. Vel, Qui
sapit est heatus· Si est Philosophus, sapit ; ergo Si
cst Philosophus, est heatus. Vel, Si sopit, est heatus:
Si cat Philosophus, sopit,· ergo Si cat Philosophus,
eat heatus. Nos de eo tantum loqui instituimus
qui est caeteris usitatior, in quo nempe Major
Hypothetical.

⁸ Hypothetical syllogismo, in the present sense ol thetonis, ’

are not treated of by Aristotle. An exposition of them was
first sketohed out by Theophrastus, which was afterwards
further developed by Eudemus and the Stoics. Nune of these
works, however, have come down to us. Afew notices may
be getirered from the Greek commentators; but our principe]
extant authority ou the subjectis Boethius. Of the συλλο-
γισμοὶ ἐξ ὑποθέσεως of Aristotle, which Pacius has confounded‚
and M. St Hilaire attempta to identify, with the hypotheticals
of Theophrastus, some account will be given in the Appendix‚
note Ι. In the Prolepomenc Lophos, p. 211, I have given a
theory of hypotheticals different from that commonly adopted
by Logicians. But that theory, though I believe it to be
more accurate tiran that of Aldrich differs too widely from
his text to be admissible here. Ihave therefore transferred
it to the Appendix, note I.

⁸ Thia ia the only kind of hypothetica} syllogism in which
the conclusion is categorical. If the minor promise, or both
promises, are hypothetical, the conclusion is so too. A
syllogism with all three propositione hypothetical was called
by Theophrastus, δι’ ὅλου hedwich, (Scholia, p. 179, a. lh.)
