the object- defined must in every case be a Species. Summa
Genera and Individuals are in that case alone inde·
fiuable. And for this limitation, the authority of Aristotle
may be cited. On the other hand, Loclrcb assuras us
that this restriction is erroneous, and that Simple [deas
alone are incapable oi Definition0. The disputa may be
reduced to a mere verbal question. For Aristotle does
not maintain that all Definitions must be by Genus aud ·
Differentia, but only those oi Substances. ln the pas·
seges which seem to extend this rule, Definition is used
in the narrovv sense which has been previously men·

Descartes‚ Princip. i. 10. Sir W. Humilton (Reid’s Worhs, p. 220.) main·
tains that Aristode has said the same thing. It is dangerous to disputa
any thing vvhich a man of Sir William¹s learning professes to have dis·
covered in so wide a field as Aristode, especially as he gives no reference&
but if the passage alludcd to be Metaplr.vi.17.7. one might be tempted to
hazard a different interpretation. Τὰ ἁπλᾶ seem rather to he the clemente,
(dead σώματα, Met. vii. l. 2.) which have not, like compound substances,
received a definite form, and thus are not dcfinable. cf. Plato, Theoet.
p. 205. c. But the words are not sufficiently decisive to furnish much
ground for any theory. A more remarkable passage occurs in Occam's
Logic, Pt. i. ch. 23. ‘¹ Ex praedictis sequitur quod nulla intentio quoe cst
praecise communis rebus simplicibus carentibus compositione ex materia et
forma habet differentias essentiales ; quianon habet partes, quamvis possit
habere multas differentias accidentales. Ex illo sequitur ulterius quod
nulla species qua cst praecise simplicium est definibilis definitione proprie
dicta, sive sitin genere substantiae sive in quocunque alio predicamento?
This, coupled with Occam's Conceptualist theory ol Universals, is not very
different from Locke's position concerning Simple Idcas.

⁶ By Simple Ideas, Locke meant all ideas derived immediately from
sensation or reflection. In the formation of these the mind is wholly
passive‚wlrcreas in the formation from themoi complex Ideas, it is active.
Among Simple Ideas derived from sensatim, he enumeratas solidity,
space, figure, rest, end motion; lrom reflection, perception and volitionr
from both, pleasure and pain.
