The Example is sometimes loosely called reasoning
from Anaayps. This term, however, properly belongs,
not to absolute similarity in any given quality, but only
to similarity of relations. Thus Aristotle speaks of an
aneloyy between sight aud iutelleot, the one being re-
lated to the body as the other to the south. And the
argument of Bishop Butler’s Arroloyy of Religion to the
Corutitation aad Coarse os Nature may be put into the
same form. The difficulties iu Religion, natural and
revealed, have the same relation to their respective
systema, that the difficulties in the course of nature hare
to the entire system of nature. If then the latter be
admitted to proeeed from a Divine Author, the diffi-
eulties in the two former are not a ralid objection
against a like origin. This reasoning from Analogy
eorrespouds to what is sometimes called the Indue·
tion οι Socrates, and to the παραβολὴ mentioned by
Aristotle, Rhet. ii. 20. 4) Like the Example proper, it

has no logioal value3 its symbolioal form being, A is
to B as Oto D3 Ais X, thereforeOis Χ. Here it is
evident that the premise may be true and yet the oon·
olusion false. Its material velue, like that of Example,
may admit of any degree, from zero to moral certainty. ⁴
