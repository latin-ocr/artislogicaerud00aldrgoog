A recent writer has exhibited the luductive Method of
Socrates as a specimen of that Inductio per enumera-
tionem simplicem which the Bacenian philosophy has
superseded‘. But it has been before observed that the
Socratis reasoning is not properly Inductioo, but Exemplo.
Itis inconelusive, not because it is au Induction by
Simple Enumeration, but because it is no Induction at

· · all. The Simple Enumeration, if complete, will ferm.

the basis of what, logically speaking, is a valid induction,
and it is precisely because the Socratis Method does
not pretend to completenesS, that Legio does not recog·
nise the inferenee. It is true that in Simple Enumeration
this completeness is often difficult, sometimes impossible
to attain. And it is the additional security on this point
that constitutes the chief meritos the Baconian process,
But this is a material, not a loyiool, merit. It affeots our
qroaod os coopideoce in the trutb of certain propositions,
not the notare of tlte infereoce from those propositions
assumed to be true. Neither in Induction nor in Syl-
logism does the Organon ol Baeon supersede that of
Aristode. “ Each‚'' as Sir W. Hamilton observeS,
“proposes a different end; both, in different ways, arc
usefulssss’ The ancient Philosopher considers “the laws
under which tlte subject thinks ;'' the modern, “those
under which tlte object is to be known.” The lnduotion
of Bacon, as furnishing more accurate rules for physical

investigation, may supersede the Induction ol Socrates3
for the latter owes its validity solely to the matter. It
cannot affect the Induction of Aristotle, of whioli the
validity depends solely on the form.

The perversions of the Aristotelian Induction by Aldrich
and Archbishop Whately have already been notieed. On
this point it will be sufficient to observe, that any attempt
