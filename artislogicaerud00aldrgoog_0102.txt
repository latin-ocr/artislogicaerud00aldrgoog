to mark the previous four pairs 66 contradictories‚ 61 which
666 666 must be true the other false. Subsequent Logicians,
following 666 Greek Commentators, have multiplied tho
number of modes od infinitum. Any adverb annexed to the
predicate, “bomo currit calocitcr‚’' or even 66 adjective qualifying
the subject, “bomo 61666 666616,” was regarded as forming a
modal, Τ66 aomo τρόπος, 66 applied both to the modes of
propositione and to those 61 syllogisms‚ is 666 Aristotelian,
but comes from the Greek Commentators (Ammonius, 86661·
p. 130. a. 16.)

The post-Aristotelian modes affect the subject or tho
predicate 61666, nottho 66166166 between them. They 666
thus only pure propositione with complex terms, 66 16
remarked by Melanchthon, Erotcmato Dialectica p. 182.
Aristotle's modes affect the copula and the manner 61
thinking, and are psychologioally distinct forms of the pro-
position, 66 they are rightly treated by Κ666, Kritilt dor r. V.

‘Da inissa—rot ὑπάρχειν. We find two expressions in
Aristotlo, both 61 which are sometimes rendered by ‘⁶ bciaq ia.”
1. ὑπάρχειν, by which the predicata is said 666616 666 cahom.
This is equivalent 66 κατηγορεῖσθαι· τὸ Α ὑπάρχει παντὶ τῷ B=rb
A κατηγορεῖται κατὰ παντὸς τοῦ Β :All B is A. 2. εἶναι ἐν, by
which the aabjaot is said to be in the 66666666. Almo ἐν ὅλῳ
τῷ B=All A is B. This is exactly the reverse ο1κοπργοριῖποι.
