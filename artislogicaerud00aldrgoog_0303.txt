A demonstration os this kind certainly falls short, in
some respecta, of the scholastic model. The predicate
and subject in each proposition, aa stated, are not con-
rertible3 and the middle term is not a definit-ion of the
minor. But of these requisitions, the first seems to be
founded on an erroneous interpretation of Aristode,
according to which that Philosopher is supposed to
spealr of the· Propositions as they appear when strictly
enunciated in logical form ; not (as seems more probable)
of the same Propositions as ordinarily stated by the
Geometer⁰. With regard to the second condition, the
text of Aristotle does not warrant its imposition. He
says indeed, that the middle term in demonstration must
be a definition oi the major⁹,· and the precept is intel-
ligible enough, if we rightly understand his theory of the
Definition of Attributes, As regards the minor term, it
would he difficolt to produce a single passage where this
condition is clearly laid down asa law of Demonstration;
and there is more than one with which it would be no
easy task to reconcile it.

If it be thought somewhat over-bold to repudiate
positions which so many eminent Logicians have
regarded as legitimate deductions from the text of
Aristotle3 it. must be rememhered that we hare other
data for interpretation besides the mere weight of autho-
rity. Aristotle’s theory of demonstration is principally
framed with reference to Geometry: the Scholastic
examples‚ on the other hand, are Physical. The medi-
aeval state of Plrysical science was perhaps such as to
justify‚ or at least to account for, the Logical and Meta-
