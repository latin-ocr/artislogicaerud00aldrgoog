regarded as a saell, a sanction, a fact os coruciousness. These
again aro first intentions. A second intention or notiori is a
conception under which the mind regards its first intentione
as related to each other. Thus the relation of animal to man.
and of man to eniteat, is expressed in the second intention
pennu or species. First intentione, as conceptions of things.
are predicable ol the individuals conceired under them.
Thus we may say, “Socrates is man, animal, &cl' Second
intentioris are not so predicable: we cannot say, “Socrates
is species, genus, &cf Hence when we are told that a
prediceble is ceramum, uicinorum, secunde intentionis, it is not
meant that all universals are in thernselces second intentions;
but that every predicate mered ia relation to its subject may be
comprehended under one os Porphyry's five classes of pre
dicables; all which are second intentioris So when Genus

· is said to be predicable of Species 11 is not meant that we can ·

predicate the one second intention of the other, so as to say,
“Species is Genus ;” but that the first intention “ animal· is
predicable of the first intention “man ;” the relation of the
one to the other being expressed hythe second intentioris
“ genus‘ and “species'' For this reason Logic was said to
treat of second intentione applied to first. See Aquinas, Opusc.

The distinction between first and second intentioris is
generally considered as of Arabian origin. Scotus however¹

writings do not confirm the statement It is found in
