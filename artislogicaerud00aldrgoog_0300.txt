lt is not denied that there are passages in Aristotlo
which may seem to eorrntenance this interpretati0n3 but
there are others so palpably inconsistent with it that
we are compelled to seek for a new explanation of the

former.

ln the lirst ploce, Aristotle distinetly condemns the
assumption ol Delinitions as a Petilio Principii ³, acharge
to which the above example is obviously liable; the real
question to be proved being, that the three-sided figure
has its angles equal to tivo right angles, whether it is
called a triangle or not. ln the second place, he says
that Demonstration proceeds from oriente, and cites
as a specimen of the latter, “If equale be taken from
equals, the remainders are equal¹.” These axioma,
he says, are common to many classes of objeots3 but,
in any single Seianae, need only be assumed to an
extent commensurate with the object-matter of that
Science. The above axiom, for example, is true of
other things besides Geomettieal Magnitudes, but it is
sufficient for the Geometer to assume it as true of these

onl .
llow if an axiom of this kind be the major premise in

a Demonstrati0n‚ it is manifest that its predicate will
also be the predicate of the Conclusi0n3 and that the
logical form of that conclusion will be, not “All
triangles are ligures having their angles equal to tvvo
right angles,'’ but, “Triangles and figures having their
angles equal to two right angles are equal to each
other.'’

The immediate Syllogism from which this proposition
is proved by Euclid, may be logically stated as follows;
