182 cernuum.

the sun’s light is intercepted by the earth. What is
an eclipse? An intercepting of the sun's light from the
moon by the earth. Thunder in the same way is defined,
ἅπόσβεσις ungis ἓν νέφει, the answer to tbe question tat ri
βροντῇ being tut τὸ ἀποσβέννυσθαι τὸ σῦς ἐν τῷ νέφει.

This kind of definition, as hasbeen obserred, differs
from a demonstration in the position (θέσις) of its
δειπνεῖς for it has the same terme (ἔκλειψις, ἀντίφραξις,
σελήνῃ-βροντή, &rictiacus ιινςὸς, recog) but not in the same
order, and with some variety of grammatical form (πτῶσιςὶ).

The Definition, then, of an Attribute is to be found in
its (lause. But the Aristotelian Philosophy recognises
four Causea and sometimes more than one of these is
concerned in the production of the same effect. Which

ι of these is to be taken as the Definition? In AnalPost.

ii. ΙΙ. Aristotle shows that any one of the four may be
used as a middle term in demonstration3 but it by no
means follows that eaoh may be aDefinition of the major

term. On this point, Aristotle's opinion is not decidedly

‘⁴ Omne corpus illuminatum ab alio, inter quod et corpus illuminansopacum
corpus sic interponitur, ut umbra opaci corporis operiet et comprehendat
corpus illuminatum, eclipsatnr seu privatur suo lumine?

i The Definition is by some given as ‘¹ an obseruation of light in *the
moon, caused by the interposition of the earth.” But in this case, the
major term of the Demonstrative syllogismis not“ eclipsed,” but ‘⁸ ob-
seured.” 1f these two terme are synonymom, the Definitionis merely
nominal. and the latter part superfluous; if not, we do not define the
attribute demonstrated (obscuration), but another (eclipsc), contained under
it as species under genus. 1 interpret Aristotle’s words as referring to the
complex form of the· Definition¹ as given in question and ausum, or in a
proposition-cl ἐστιν euterpe ἀντίφραξις ὑπὸ γῆγῆ ἔκλειψίς ἔστιν ἀντίφραξις
ὑπὸ γῆς, So the third form of Definition mentioned An. Pr. ii. 10. resembles
the conclusion of a Demonstration, as containing, in the same form, only
the major and minor terme, (Bporrhffe‘oos) ἡβρονιή ἐστι ψόφος ἐν νέφει.
Aristotle’s text is not decisive, the one view being rather supported by
ch. 8. the other by ch. 10. The questionis byno means unimportant ς the
attempt to reduce these Definitions to apseudo-Genus and Differentia has
fostered a grave error, which will be noticed herenfter.

² Pacius aud Waitz consider πτῶσις and olcis to be synonymous·
