cognito, oui intellectus assentiat, procedatur ad certitudinem
accipiendam de aliquibus ignotis. Cum autem Logica dicatur
rationalis scientia, necesse estquod ejus consideratio versetur
eirca ea, quae pertinent ad tres praedictas operationes rationis.”
Aquinas in Periherm. Lect. 1. cf. Opusc. xlviii. Tract. de Syll.
cap. l. The passage alluded to by Aquinas is De An. iii. 6. 1.
ἡ μὲν οὖν τῶν ἀδιαιρέτων νόησις ἕν τούτοις περὶ d οὐκ ἔστι τὸ ψεῦδος· ἔν
οἷς δὲ τὸ ψεῦδος καὶ τὸ ἀληθές, σύνθεσίς τις ἤδη νοημάτων ὥσπερ ἓν
ὄντων. Ἀδωίρετα are either ἀριθμῶ or εἴδει. Metaph. ix. l. 4.
The latter only are νοητά, the former αἰσθητά. cf. Anal. Post. i.
2411.

⁰ Simple Apprehensi0n‚ in the only sense in which it can
have any connection with Legio, isan operationes Thouyht,
and is more properly called Conception. It is necessary to
distinguish Thought, which is representative, and whose
immediate objectis an universal notice, gained by comparison
and indifferently applicable te many individuals, from the
various intuitive faculties‚ which are presentatiee and whose
immediate objectis an individual thing, act, or state ol mind,
existing without or within ourselves. This distinction is
properly psychological‚ but must be carefully borne in mind
in reference to the logical character ol Thought. A fuller
explanation is given in Proleyomena Legite, Chap. Ι.

‘¹ Among various intuitive faculties it is necessary tedis
tinguish between Semetiom Perception, and Imaginatian. The
two former are distinguished by Stewart, Oatlines os Morol
Philosophy, ἦ. 15. “ Seruatiou expresses merely that change
in the stete os the mind which is produced by an impression
upon an orgen ol sense; ol which change we can conceive the
mind to be consciens without any knowledge of externa]
objects. The word Pereeptioa expresses the knowledge we
obtain, by means ol our sensatione, ol the qualities of matter.'’
