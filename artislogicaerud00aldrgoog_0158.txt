confounded with the inquiry, whether the hypothetical pro·
position is formally the same with the categorical. The latter
is answered by Kant in the negative, but that decision does
not effect the present question. The reduction of hypothetica]
syllogismo must be gevemed by the same rules as that of
categoricals; and in the latter ease, itis allowable to substitute
for a given proposition another which, though not identical, is
implied by it. For instance, a particular converse is employed
instead of its universal exposita. Scin hypotheticals‚ if the
new propositione oontain the same terma, aud are immediately
deducible from the original ones, the reductionis legitimate.
This will generally be the case when the hypothetical pro-
position has but three terms; both clauses having the same
subject or the same predicate. The following instaures may
thus be reduced :—
1.1sA11AisB,A11Aisc‚ AllBis0‚
ButAllAisB; to AllAisB3
.·.A11Aisc. .·.AllAisG.
11.1fA11AisB,AnoisB, AllAisB,
ButAllAisB; to ΙΑΠΟἱεΑς
All G is B. All C is B.

'These syllogismo, indeed, were admitted by the Ramista,
'the great advocates of hypotheticam, to be categorical. But
where the hypothetical has four terms, as, ‘⁴ If A is B, 0 is
D,'' this mode of reduction is not practicable; yet even in
*this case a categorical syllogism may be constructed, whose
propositione, though expressed in different terms, are implied
in those οἰ the original syllogism. Thus:
Constructive. Destructive.
Every case of A being B, is a Every case ol A being B, is a
case of‘c being D. case of O being D.
This is a case of A being B. This is notacase ol C beingD.
This is a case of G being D. .·.ThisisnotacaseoshbeingB.
