Tus eagle of the Libyan iable was killed by an arrow
leothered from his own wing. The armoury oi the
Logioian has beon fondly imagined to eontain the fatal
weapon oi his own destruction. But the champion
destined to wield it, if suoh there be, is somewhut tardy
in his forthcoming. More than one sir Kay has essayed
the adventure oi the sword; the Artbur destined to
eohieve it remains in all the mysterious dignity of a
Ooming Man. In other words, many writers have suo··
oeeded in showing their own ignoranoe of the nature oi
the fallaoy oalled Petitio Prinoipii⁸3 they have not been
equally successful iu proving the invalidity of the
Syllogistio process.

Let us first endeavour to asoertain what the Potitio
Prinoipii really is. The name is a blundering trans·
lation ol the Aristotelian sl h &exi (or τὸ ἐξ ’ἂςχῆη
arsula: i. e. the assumption, not of tho principle properly
so callem, but, in some form or other, of tho question
originally proposed for proof. And it is remarkable, that
among the five modes of this fallaoy enumerated by

ι01 tbe numerous absurdities gravely propounded hy Logioians in
relation to this fallaoy, perhaps the happiest is tho exquisite etymology oi
Du Maronis, Loqique, p. 81. “Ge mot s'appelle plenum de principe, du mot,
grec πέτομαι, qui signiflu valer vers quelque eleae, et du mot latin principium,
qui veut dire commencemeat; ainsi faire une pltltion de principe, o'est
reoourir sn d'autros tarmes a la mima ohose quo oe qui a d'abord tte mis
eu question.”

b“Without entoring on the various meanings oi the term Prinoiple,
ulrich Aristotle deflues, iu general, llot from wlu'elt ang thing calamis
produced, or ie known, it is aussloient to say, that it is always used lor that
on whioh something elsa depends; and thus both for an original law, and
sor an originsl clament? Sir W. Hamilton, Reid's Worln, p. rol.
