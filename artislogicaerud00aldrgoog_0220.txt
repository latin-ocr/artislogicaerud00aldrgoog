In treating the doctrine of Predicables, two alter·
natives are open to the medem Logician. Either he
may take the scholastic langnage as he finds it, and
explain it with reference to the theorice on which it
was originally founded3 naming, however, at the same
time his readers or hearers, that the supposed Real
Essenoes are deserving of the same amount cf belief
as the Deities of Heathen Mythology, or the Sylphs,
Gncmes, and Salamanders of the Rosiorucians: cr he
may adopt a theory of Universals in conformity with
vicws current in modern philosophy, and remedel the
whole account cf the predicables, so as to make it
consistent therewith. But any attempt at a oompromise
between the two, any explanation cf ancient language
upon modern hypotheses, can produce nothing but in·
consistency in the Teacher and confusion in the Pupil.
In the first place, such explanation, even where most
satisfactory, is founded merely cn analogy, and hence
will rather shew what the doctrines expcunded ought
to have been, according to modern criticism, than what
they actually were. In the second place, the analogy
in some important particulare will fail entirely, and
the excepticnal cases must either by some unnatural
distorticn be forced under the given claesificadon, or
be excluded altogether, tc the serious detriment of the
completeness of the theory.

Tc adopt then the first mode of explanation. We will
suppose that Genera and Species are alstanus, having
areal existence independently of us, and cognisable as
to their nature, nc matter how, by the human mind. Of
these universal substances, some are more extensive,
others less so, the limite at both extremities being fixed
by nature, and the numbers in each degree settled and
unalterable. The higher enter into the composition of
,the lower, the lowest not contributing to form any other
