that which is incapable oi definition, and whioh in con-
sequence necessarily involves its own failure. The same
may be said oi the principa] opinion which Aristotle
controverts. Whether we regerd Pleasure with Plato,
es consisting in a motion towards a natural state oi
harmony, or with Aristotle, in the perfect exereise of ο,ι
powcr; neither of these een be termed an explanation
of the feeling itsclf, but only of the cause by which itis
produced. Pleasure itself remeius an indefinite some·
thing, consequent on the one or the other. Yet examined
according to Aristotle’s own view of the definition of
attributes, we see that pleasure is as fairly defined by
the perfection os the energy‚ as an eclipse by the inter·
ception of light ¹. ·

There ere, however, conditione aud limite to the
defiuitions of Attvibutes, though they are not the seme
as those of Substances. Every Substance to be definable
must be a Species. Every Attribute must be anopertg,
i. e. must be capable of demonstration by its cause.
Accidents then, es merely contingent attributes, are
incapeble of definition. This limitation, however, is
merely relative to the degree of our knowledge of the
matter. The advauce of Science may transform Acci·
dents into Properties, and thus fumish the requisito
means of definition.

Before concluding the subject, it will be necessary to
say a few words on two other points connected with
Aristotle’s doctrine of Definition.

‘Leibuitz adopts the seme view es Aristotle, observing thet pleasure
admits os a causat, though not oi a rromtnal defluitiou. Nouveauae Ertaia,
ilat. ate. ln another point os view, simple ideas edmit oia delinition by
logical snalysis; viz.when they rue considered not es phenomana presented
to the sense, to be resolved into simplcr sensible phenomena, but as oon·
cepte, orgenerel notione, representative oi objecto os thought, to be resolved
into simpler concepta. On this distinction I heva remutet elsewhere.
