imposed for the purpose of distinguishing individuale
from each other.

But though our earliest complex notions may have
been gained from real objeots, there is no reason why
such notione alone should be admitted in a theory of
Predication. Such a theory only distinguishes th'e several
relations which the subject and predicate of a proposition
may bear to each other. With the objective existence of
things corresponding to our general notions, we have for
the present no concern. Whatever theory may be adopted
as to the origin of our ideas, there oan be no doubt that
we have the power of forming combinatione in the mind,
which have not been observed to exist in naturam. And

the relation of subject and predicate in propositione into

which such notions enter, may be identified with some ol
the relations of other notione.

In oonstruoting or explaining a theory of Predioation
in conformity with these views, there is one ambiguity
which it is not possible to avoid, without a coinage of
new terme. The distinctions of Genus and Differentiae
must be gained by comparing two terms not predicable
of each other. Compare, for example, Man with Brute,
the common Genus will be Animal, the respective Diffe-
rentiae, Rational and Irrational. But there is no absolute
Genus or Differentia, aud frequently, while the whole
comprehension of the notion remeius the same, the Genus
and Differentia may change places, according as it is
compared with this or that other notion. In the com·
parison, for example, of a plane triangle with a paral- 5
lelogram, “ rectilineal figure” is its common, “having
three sides” its distinotive part. But compare a plane
with a spherical triangle, “having three sides” is common
to both; the distinction being, that the sides in the one
