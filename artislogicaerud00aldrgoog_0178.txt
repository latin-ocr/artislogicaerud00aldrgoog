De Mettodo⁸.

ᾖ. l. Massones est talis dispositio partium ali·
cujus disciplinae, ut integra facilius discaturl.

⁸ Μέθοδος in Aristotle is employed with various shades of
meaning; 1. for any instrument of acquiring or communicating
knowledge; as in de An. i· l. 4. πότερον ἀπόδειξίς τίς darer l) deol-
ρεσις t) καί τις ἄλλη μέθοδος. ef. Philoponus, Scholia, p. 281, a. 10.
2. for knowledge reduced to system; and thus as equivalent
to ἐπιστήμηε Phys. Ausc. i. 1. 1. Eth. Nic. i. l. 1. Top. i. 2. 2.
2. lora systematis heatise on any hranch of knowledge,
synonymous with πραγματείας Polit iv. 2. 1. vi. 2. 6. Eth. Nic.
i. 2. 2. But method‚ in the present sense of awaaqement, is
not treated ol in the logical writings of Aristotle, with the
exceptiones a few rules for the arrangement (τάξις) ot a dialec-
tical disputation in the eighth book of the Topies. Alost
treatise, called Methodiea, is mentioned in the Rhetoric, Ι. 2.
Method, as a distinct part of Logic, was first introduced by
Ramus', and from him passed to the logical writings ot the
Oartesians and of Gassendi, by whom it was treated as a
fourth part os Logic. Like most of the additions to the
Aristotelian system, it was originally the property of the
Rhetoricians.

⁵ Method has been treated of by Logiciane in two principal
censes. l. As aprocess of inference from the known to the
unknown ; which is the earlier sense os the term, and sanc·
tioned by Aristotle and his Greek interpretare. 2. Ae an
arrangement of truths already known, with a view of com·
munieating them to others. The last corresponds to the
Greek τάξις, and should rather be called Ordo. lt is distin-
guished from the first by Zabarella and othere. aldrich's
definition corresponds only to the second sense os Metlarius:
hut in his subsequent division he coniounds it with the first.
