In Plato we find slso the analysis of the Proposition,
with the noun and the verb as ita constituent elemenn3
the union of the two being necessary to every assertion.
aaron and λόγος correspond to each other as the l ἔσω
and ὁέξω λόγος of Aristode3 the tormer being interual
discourse without speech, the latter external, hythe
voice. Adys is divided into φάσις and &alturus ln this
passage, Plato has furnished the groundworlr of tha
grammatical rescarches cf the De Interpretctione.

The three highest lawa of thought, the Principles of
Identity, contradiction, and Excluded Middla, are also
indicated, though not explicitly enunciated, in Plato Ρ.
But neither he nor Aristotle has accuretely distinguished
between their very different positione in Logic and
in Metaphysics. Indeed, this distinction cannot be con-
sidered as having been mede with exaotness by any
philosopher before Kant.

Some few elements of the Legio of Aristotle thus
appear in the philosophy of his predecessors3 though
the soience was not accurately distinguished either from
Grammar or from Metaphysios. A distinct treatment of
logical questions was undeniably first undertalen hy the
Stagirite ; though still, if we regard the Organon as a
single work, with a considerable admixture of extraneous
matters, which a more accurate classifioation of the
sciences would relegata to Metaphysics, to Psychology,
to Rhetoric, or to Grammar. But Aristotle must not be
considered as responsible for the present composition of
the Organon, bnt only for six distinct treatises, which
