his commentators hare combined into one volume*⁸ Of
these, the latter part of the Dc Interpretatiom and the
Prior Aaclpte'cr may be regarded as containing most of
the essentia! parts of pure Logis3 though, as regards the
laws and forms of judgmcnt in some degree, and of
conception almost entirely, much must bs added and
much retrenched, before we can bring the entire pro-
ducts of pure thought into harmony with tho elaborate
development of the various forms of the syllogism. The
treatise on the streperas, with the early part of the De
humectationem grammatical rather than logical, with
a few tresparscs on the domain of Metaphysics3 while

the Posterior Anclytt'ca together with the Tapae and ’

Septimio Refutetionr, eontain applicatione of Legio to
necessary and contingent matter in demonstration and
dialectis disputation, and should be accurately classed
rather as parts of the Loyicc utens than of the Lopico
doceas. But we are not justified in criticising the Organon
of Aristotle as though it were a single work composed on
a single subject.

Of the post-Aristotelian Legitima my limite will only
allow a very brief notice. To Theophrastus is attributed
the invention of the Hypothetical Syllogism‚ which was
afterwards more fully developed by Eudemus and the
Stoice. The Stoice bavo already been noticed as the
probahle authors cf the name Lepte, and of the division
of philosophy into Legio, Physica, and Etbics. The
Stoical Legio, while it had less admixtum of Meta-
physics than the Aristotelian', embraced on the other
hand considerably more of Grammar and of Rhetoric.

s On the composition of the Organon, some further remarks will be
found, Proleyomena Βορέω, p. 261. The name Orpenna, according to M.
st. Hilcire, was not habitually giren to the collected worka before the
loth century. Mlmoire, vol. i. p. 19.
