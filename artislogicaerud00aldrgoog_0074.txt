Whereas the original universale, whether substanoes or at
tributos, as “mam'' or “whiteness,'’ were called obsolute.
Again, by an aot ol the mind, the terme signifying substanoes
may be oonoeived in the form os attributes, so as to be no
longer predioable of the individ‘uals; thus “homo'' becomes
“humanitas'' All such terms, not predieable oi singular
substanees, whether primarily attributae, as ‘⁴ whiteness,'‘ or
secondnrily conceived as attributes, as “humanity,'' are called
obstruet terms; all that are predicable os the individuals,
whether primarily, as “homo'’ or seoondarily, as ‘⁴ wlrite,'' are
concrete. Hence the two divisione are distinctio principle,
though some of the members of eaoh oross. For example:
Homo is concrete and absolute, albus eonorete and sonno-
tative, albedo abstreat aud absolute; but no abstraot termis
oonnotative.

The above account differs considerably from thet given by
Mr. Mill, Legio, b. i. ohap. 2. He inverte the phraseology‚
deseribing the attribute instead of the subject as oonnoted,
and extends connotative tenne, so as to include all oonerete
general names. This isin some respeots an improvement on
the scholastio distinction, but it must not be oonsounded with
it. The materials of the present note are chiefly from Ooeom,
Logia, p. i. ohap, b, 10. It must be admitted. however, that
there is some lieenoe in the use of the word connotative.
