or forteal port is composed of those attributes which are
peculiar to each. Thus, if there be given three concepte,
containing respectively the attributes, ab, oc, bc, a ie the
genus ol the first compared with the second, b and c the
respective differencee. But if the firet ie compared with the
third, b becomes the common genus, a and c the respective
differencee. In this, the only teneble logical point ol view,
there can be no euch thing es an absolute genus or
difference.

‘Necessario-Gentianam. This distinction is based on
the supposition that certain attributes are necessarily con-
nected with othere, from which they flow, ae effect from
cause. Thus risibility was described in the scholastic philo·
sophyae necessarily flowing from rationalia, in the same
manner es having the angles et the base equal to each other
necessarily results from the equality of two eides in an
isosceles triangle. But this theory, originally horrowed from
the mathematice, is not true of any eucceeeion of physicel
phenomena. Ae a matter of lact, we experience thau certain
events are invariahly conjoined, hut there ie not, ae in mathe-
maticel demonstratione, any necessity that they must he eu.
Invariable succession, in lact, ie the highest positive action
of causality to which we can attain in the case of sensible
phenomena, though thie limitetion does not include the
moral causality of which we are conscioue in volition, Neces-
sity, however, in any eense ie untenable ae a logical criterion
ol property, since it preeuppoeee an acquaintance with the
lewe of any given physical phenomena, of which the logiciae
ae euch knowe nothing. A better logical distinction between
property and accident is that given by Aristotle, ol the corr·
aaran and aaa convertitis attribute. See Appendix‚ note A.
