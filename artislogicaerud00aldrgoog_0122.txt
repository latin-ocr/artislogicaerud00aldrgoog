alicujus tertii3 idque propter Cenones sequentesl,
in quibus vis omnis Syllogistica fundatur.

l. Quee conveniunt in uno aliquo eodemque
tertio, ea conveniunt inter se.

¹¹ These Canens are an attempt to reduce all the three
figures oi syllogism directly to a single principle; tho dictam
de omni ct callo of Aristotle, which was universally adopted
by the scholastic Logicians, being directly epplicable te the
first figure only. This reduction, sc long as the predicate
of propositione has no expressed quantity, is illegitimate;
the terme not being cqual, but contained one within another,
as is denoted hythe names major end minor. Hence, as
applied to the firet figure, the word conveniant has to express,
ι at one and the same timo, the relation oia greater to aless,
end of a less to a greater-of a predicate to e subject, and of
a subject to apredicate. In the system of Sir W. Hemilton,
by assIgning a quantity to the predicate, the terme ol every
proposition are oquel in extent; and the Oenone become
legitimate representatives of the syllogism; but in this case
they are only narrower statements oi the true syllogistic laws;
which are given in the Principles ol Identity and Contra·
diction. (EveryA is A; No A is not A.) These, with the
Principle of Excluded Middle‚ (Every thing is either A or
not Α,) are the highest and most exact statemente ol the
Necessary Laws of Thought. of. Protegenteaa Logica, p. 228.

Wallis mentions the Canens as recent innovatione in Logic.
“Nonnulli autem Logici, (nostri seculi aut superioris.) post
habita veterum probatione per Dictum dc Omni et de Natta,
eliud substituunt illius loco Postulatum ; nimirum, Qaoe ooa-
ccav'ant t'a eodem tertie conveniant inter ae. Iast. Lep. l. iii. c. ὁ.
cf. Bacon. Noc. Org. l. ii. aph. tt. Melanehthontnroemaa,
p. 172.) mentions them as adopted by a sect oi Logicians in
his day. The earliest writer in whom Ι heve found them is
Rodolphus Agricole, De Iov. Dici. i. 2. He describes at con·
siderable length the office ol the middle term as e measure of
equality or inequality.
