And if there be any such cases, the opponente of the

¹ One class oi reasonings are perhaps fairly chargeable with the fallacy.
I allude to what are commonly called the proper syllepsim of the Ramists,
which have two Singular Premises. In the first figure, it is evident that
the conclusion is not one out of many inferences contained in the major
premise, hut the very same proposition stated in different language. The
third figure is open to the same objection, hut it may he allowed as an
ἔκθεσις or expository instance—a process not reckoned hy Aristotle as
syllogistic. Proper syllogisms in the second figure are valid, and frequently
serviceahle; hut when reduced to the first, (which Aristotle regards as a
necessary test ol validity‚) the negative premise must he converted from =
singular to universal.

Nevertheless, as the Potitio Principii is a material, not alogieal, iallsoy,
this does not furnish grounds for objecting to the convenient arrangement
hy which singular propositione are considered ss in syllogism equivalent
to universals. They may he regarded, in common with other cases of the
same fallacy‚ as reasonings valid in form, but unsound from material
circumstances.

The Proper Syllogisms, however, though a post-Aristotelian innovation,
did not originate with Remus. Aquinas expressly denies that hoth promises
in a syllogism may be singular, and admits the desecas us a non-syllogistic
process, heing an appeal to the senses, not to the reason. See Opusc. xlvii.
init. Occem‚ on the other hand, virtually surrenders the whole principle,
when he allows that the major premise in the first figure may he singular.
