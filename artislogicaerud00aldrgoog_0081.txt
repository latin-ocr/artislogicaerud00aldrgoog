Oceani, Logica, p. i. cap. 20, ΩΙ. To dhcuss the full bear-
ings of this controversy would exeeed the limits ofa note,
lt will be sufficient to observa that a considerable portion ol
the language adopted by Aldrich is not even intelligible,
except ou realistis principlea; and that whenever the same
lauguage is adopted hya Nominalist, he is inevitably involved
in inconsistencies and seli-contradictione The same is in
some degree true ol the original exposition of Porphyry,
though the latter professes to leave the question of Nomi·
nalism and Realism open. But the question ol the existence

no theory ou this point ought to influence the language ol

in speaking of the logical predicables. On the realist point

forma, transit in statuam, ita genus, accepta differentia, transit
in speeiem.'’ Boethius de ἀὶοίείοηο. But as logicians, we are
not warranted in introducing any portion of the cssence os

essence of a concept is the sum ol the attributes which it

formal part ol a single concept is nonsense,) is the sum of
thaso attributes which are common to botlr; as the di ercam
