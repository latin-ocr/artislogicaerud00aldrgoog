A, then all Ο is B:” and the actual assertion of the
truth of these premises vvill furnish at once aso-called

hypothetical syllogism: “But all A is B, and all (l is A,
therefore all Ο is B.” This vvas observed hy Fries, who
hence rightly maintains that analytical hypothetical
jndgments are formal syllogismsk. Itis strange that,
after this, he should not have gone a step further, and
discovered that synthetical hypothetica] judgments are
assertions of material consequences. The judgment‚
“If A is B, C is D,” asserts the eiristence of aconse-
quence necessitated by lavvs other than those of thought,
and consequently out of the province of Logic. The
addition of a minor premise and conclusion iu the so-
called hypothetical syllogism, is merely the assertion
that this general material consequence is verified in a
particular case.

The distinction so much insistcd on by the Kantians,
of the problematical character of the two members of a
hypothetical judgment, is, like the whole Kantian doc·
trine of modality, of no consequence in formal Logic.
All formal thinking is, as regards the material character
of its objects, problematical only. Forma} Conception
pronounces that cenain objects of thought may possibly
exist, leaving their actual existence to he determiued by
experience. Formal Judgment decides on the possible
coexistence of certain concepts3 and Formal Rcasoning,
on the truth of a conclusion, subject to the hypothesis of
the truth of its premises.

To state that this hypothesis is in a certain instance
true, adds nothing to the logical partos the reasoning,
but only verilies the empirical preliminaries which the
Logician in every case assumes as given. To exhibit
a formal consequence hypothetically, is only a needless
reassertion of the existence of data which the act
