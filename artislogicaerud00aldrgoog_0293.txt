other circumstances not mentioned in the hypothesis
at all ⁰.

It thus appears, that the only hypothetical judgment
which can be employed as the real major premise of
a syllogism, may be expressed in the form, “ lf any A
is B, it is C‚” where A, Β, and (l represent concepte
or general notions The complete categorical equivalent
to this is, “ Every A which is B is 0, because it is B,''
which admits of two interpretatione, according as B
stands for the physical cause of the fact, or for the
logical reason of cur huowing it. In the latter case,
the judgment is analytical, and represents a disguised
formal consequence with B as a middle term: e. g.
“Erery man who is learned has studied, because he
is learned.” Here the notion of study is implied in
that of learning, and the major premise is, “All learned
beings have studied.” The hypothetical proposition
thus becomes a complete syllogism, to which the sub-

¹¹ This may be made elecrer by cn example. The following is cited by
Fries, as an instance of a hypothetica] proposition, not reducible to cate·
gorical form. “ Il Gaius is free from business he is writing poetry.” This
may be interpreted to mean either, generally, “ whenever (laius is dis·
engaged, he writes poetry;” or, specially, “ is he is now disengaged, he is
now writing poetry.” Under the former interpretation, it is a general
hypothesis, which may be applied as amaJ'or premise to particular instances:
but in this case the true form of the reasoning is, “All times when Gaius
is disengaged, are times when he writes poetry ; end the present is such
a time.” Under the latter interpretation, it is one of the cases of a
material connection of two facts mentioned in the text. Now in this
last case, it is obvious that the inlerence is really made, not from the
hypothesis, but from some circumstance linown to the reasoner, bnt not
appearing in the proposition. Any men being asked, ‘⁴ Why do you infer
that Caius, being now disengaged, is writing poetry?'’ would reply,
“Because he told me he should (10 so;” or something of the kind.
Assuredly be would never dream os replying, ‘⁴ Because tshe is now
disengaged he is writing.” In this case then he does not reason from
the hypothesis, and the expressed propositione do not compose a syl·
logism.
