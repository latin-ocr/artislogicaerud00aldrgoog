“ Rei, i. e. ο1 en universal notion existing in the mind; with·
out entering on the question whether there existe any extemel
universal nature corresponding to it. Since all such notions
are represented by worda, a real, or more correctly speaking
e ammirei, definition, will at the seme time unfold the meaning
of th'e word by which the given notion is represented. Still
the two kinds of definition must not be confounded. Α real
definition hes primarily for its object to enalyse a complex
notion into its component perte. Words are employed
aecorwlmiip, though unavoidnbly, as signe, both of the whole
notion, andos the simpler notione of which it is composed.
But the objectos nominal definition is to determine ο1 what
notion, simple or complex, a given word is the sign. The
notion may be already known, more or less clearly, by means
of other signe, though we were* not awere os its connexion
with the word in question. A different distinction between
nominal and real definitionis given by Leibnitz, Noeceaue
Esscie, l. iii. c. 8.

Ι1 this account of recl definition is correct, it will follow
thet the same notion admits of only one definition; since
the same notion cannot be a combination of more than one
group of attributes And nothing can be more clear than
Aristotle‘s testimony on these points, nothing more positive
then his repudietion ο1 the socelled occidental and physical
definitions. 101. Top. vi. 4, 2. vi. 14, 5. i. 8. 2, 3. Metaph. vi.
