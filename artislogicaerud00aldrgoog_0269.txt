the logical accuracy of his reasoning. In Dialectic‚ two
champions are opposed ιο each other: they may, before
engaging, dictate the conditione of the combat.

As regards the account of the Enthymeme in the
Prior Analytics‚ Iam not aware that any further expla-
nation is needed. But in the corresponding chapters of
the Rhetorio one or two difficulties remam, an elucida·'
tion of which, though not strictly within my present
province, may perhaps be serviceable ιο the readers of
the latter Treatise. ,

In Rhet. i. 2, 18. we are told, that when the Enthymemc
is in the third figure, the σημεῖον is to its conclusion as a
particular to an universal. ln the second figure, on the
other handus an universal to aparticular. The relation
in the first figure is not mentioned, but the context seems
rather to connect it with the former than with the latter.

This passage may be interpreted in two ways. Either
we may compare the conclusion of the Enthymeme
with the σημεῖον itself‚ or with the major promise of
that Syllogism whose minor is the σημεῖον. In the former
interpretation the word captionis used properly for the
proposition· in the latter widely, for the reasoning of
which such proposition forms a portion.

If the first interpretation be adopted, (which seems
preferable‚) we must compare the two propositione
relatively to that term in which they are unlilrc; i. e. if
they have the same subject, we must compare their

ῑ Except perhaps that Aristotle, in Anal. Pr. ii. 27, admits a σημεῖον in
the second figure, which in the former chapter ha condemned. The con-
demnaticn seems to be made on logical grounds. The logical value cl two
affirmative promises in the second figure is absolute zer0; whereas the
σημεῖον in the third figure, though faulty as employed to prove cn universal
conclusion, is valid lor particulare. For rhetorical pmposcs, however, the
second figure is also admissible3 an accumulation of Enthymcmcs, all
logicalty worthless, may amount to ammai certainty.
