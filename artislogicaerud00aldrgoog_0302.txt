There are others nhioh primo forie appear to favour
the latter3 bat, when both interpretatione require some
attaining of Aristotle's language, it is due to the memory
of the Father of Logio to give him the benefit of that
whioh does not oonviet him of flagrant error in the
applioation of his own prinoiples.

Referring baok to the Syllogism above given, the major
promise may fairly he regarded as per ιω the subjeot
forming part of the definition of the predicate. For
Equality, in the limited sense iu whioh it is employed
in Geometry, is a property of Magnitudes3 and the
letter, as the first and proper subjeot, will appear in
the definition of Geometrioal Equality. This definitior
hasbeen found by some Geometers in the eighth axiom

of Euolid3 “Magnitudes whioh eoinoide are equal ;’' .

whioh‚ stated in the Aristotelian form, would be,
“ Equality is the Goinoidenoe of Magnitudes¹².''

The minor premise may also be oonsidered as per se.
For our definition of aright angle is, that it is half the
sum of the two adjaoent angles formed by one straight
line with another3 and our notion of 'two right angles is
that of the sum of the same two adjaoent angles. As
regards the conclusion, we need not trouble ourselvea
with reduoiug it to the requisite oonditions, inasmuoh aa
it is -expressly said hy Aristotle to oomply with them.
This oomplianoe does not direotly appear in the only
form in whioh the proposition oan be syllogistioelly
proved ; but in the equipollent statement, that the
triangle is a figure of whioh the interior angles are equal
te two right angles. The predicate in this ease states a
property of the triangle, in the definition of which
property, if any be attempted, the proper subject must
be included. ’
