'The omission, therefore, in the Aristotelian list, of
separate heads of classification for mental states, cannot
be charged asa defeot in tbis point of view, so long aa
mind and its various states (whatever may be their dif-

ference in other respecta) are represented by the same
verbal forms as substances and attributes. And accord·
ingly we find various mental states, faculties, passione,
habits, and dispositions, classified together with corre·
sponding affections of body, under tbe head of qualities¹¹.
Amore vslid objection in agrammatical point of view
would be, that qualities in their abstract form are ex·
pressed by nonns substantive, and should therefore be
classed under the category of substance, This objection
would be tenable in relation to the distinctions of modern
Grammar. But Aristode appears to bave limited the
substantioe coercito terms expressive of the πρῶται οὐσίαι,
or individual substances, and the δεύτεραι οὐσίαι, or their
several genera and species· The latter denote properly
the category of substance, or substance considered as
one of the possible predicates of a proposition. Words
denoting individual substantes, being subjects only in
tbe proposition, do not properly indicate a category¹.

In reference, therefore, to the treatise of tbe sama
name, we might fairly describe the Aristotelian Gategories
as an enumeration of the different grammatioal forms of
the possible predicates of a proposition, viewed in relation
to the first substance as a subject. And tbis view is not
materially departed from in the other writings ofAristotle.
The passage quoted from tbe Topica, indeed, only con·
tinues the same view, stating that those predicates, which
