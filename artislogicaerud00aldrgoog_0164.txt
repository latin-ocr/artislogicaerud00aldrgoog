¹¹¹ This remark is taken from Wallis, and is only appliceble
to the Dilemma in his *sense of the term. The negative
induction appears categorically in this form:

There are no instanccs oi Ο being D, noros Ε being F.
But these are all the possible instanccs of Α being B.
There is no instance orn being B.

The 'Dilemma of Aldrich cannot, as it stands, be reduced to
this form. The categorical conclusion, e. g. Nullo ocor cst
ducendo, does not follow from the premises ol the Dilemma
of Bias; but requires the additional assumption, that neither
matrimonial nuieance is, under any circumstances, to be
endurcd. This brings it to Wallis's form, thus:

Si ducenda cot acor, outformosc docendo cet, cut deformis:
Atqui non ort ducendo formoso, neone deformis:
’ Erqo, Ucor non cst deceroto. (Burgersdyck, Inar. Lop. ii. 13.)

The complex Dilemma, as given above, may be reduced,
ir required, toa series of hypotheticel syllogisms, and so to
categoricals; thus:

constructive. Destructive.

IfEiaF‚GisH; IfEisF‚GisH;
IfAisnotB,EisF; IfCisD,GisnotH;
If A is not B, G is H. If G is D, Ε is uot F.

IfOisnotD‚AisnotB; IfAisB,GisD;
If O is not D, G is H. Il A is B, E is not F.

The reduction of the simple Dilemma is obvious enough.
