has no place in a system of Formal Logic. That

The Definition of Socrates has also more of a material
than a logical character. Hc continually distinguishes
between the cssencc and the qualitics cf a thing, and
insiste on determining what a thing ia, rather than what
it resembles⁸,· a distinction afterwards repudiated by his

definition. But Definition, as treated by Socrates, is a
contribution, not to Logic, hut to Metaphysios. It does
not analyse by the laws of pure thought the contents of
a given notion3 but endeavours to penetrate the real
esscnce of thingsh. The same may in some degree be
said of the Aristotelian treatment οἳ Definition in the
Posterior Analytics.
