This can scarcely be regarded as a correct analysis of
the process, unless the two members are sormalby stated
as contradictory. The Principle of Excluded Middle
asserta that every thing is either A or not A, that of two
contradictorias, one must exist in every object; as the
Principle of Contradiotion asserts that they cannot both
exist. But if the two members are not stated as contra·
dictories, if my disjunctive premis'e is, “All 0 is eitherA
or B,” I make the material assertion that All O which is
not A is B. If then Ι reason, “ This G is not Af, there·
fore itis B,” I employ the Principle of Identity in addi-
tion to that of Excluded Middle. Again, if I maintain
that No C can be both A and B,I make the material
assertion that No G which is A is B; and from hence to
reason, “This Ο is A, therefore it is not B,” requires not
the Principle of Excluded Middle, but that of Contra-
diotion. In the first case, the Excluded Middle does
not lead directly to the conclusion, but only to the con·

troposition of the minor premise. When we deny this
Oto be A, this principle enables us to essert that it is
not-A, and hence to bring the reasoning under the Prin·
ciple of Identity. But in the second case, in which one
of the opposed members is affirmed, the ground on which
we deny the other, is not because both cannot be false,
hut because both cannot he true.

It may be questioned whether this second inference is
warranted by the serm of the disjunctive promise. Boe·
thius calls it a material consequeaoe⁵,· and, in spite of the
many eminent authorities on the other side,I am still
disposed to think he is right. But let us grant for a
moment the opposite view, and allow that the proposition,
“All Ο is either A or B,” implies, as a condition of its

rThe indefinite minor, “but u is not A,” is as objectionahle in this
syllogism as in the conditional.
