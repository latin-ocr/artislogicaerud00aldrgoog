ΟΝ INDUC'I'ION.

Innucmou, as iar as it is a Logical process at all, is
equally formal with Syllogism; though proceeding in
the inverse order3 viz. from the aggregate oi individuals
to the universal whole constituted by them; instead of
nom the whole to the several individuals contained
under it. It is defined by Aristode, “proving the
major term of the middle by means of the minor· ;”
in which definition‚ the expressions major, middle, and
minor, are used relatively to their ostensiori, to designate
respectively the attribute proved, the constituted species
of which it is proved, and the aggregate of individuals by
which the species is constituted. The form in which the
Inductire Rreasoningb naturally appears, exhibits an
apparent, though not a real, resemblance to the third
figure cf Syllogism. Thus:

X, Y, Z, (minen) are B (major) ;
X, Y, Z, are all A (middle) ; therefore,
All A is B.

The resemblance to the third figure is apparent only;
the true distinctions being, l. Thetin the minor premise
of the Induction, the copula does not represent the
subject as contained under, but as constitutin9‚ the
predicate. 2. That in consequence of this distinction,

l In a loose sense,Aristotlc calls it t ἐξ ἐπαγωγῆς συλλογισμός, where
the word does not denote the syllogism proper, or reasoning hom tho
universal whole to the contained parts, but is extended to formal reasoning
in general. Inliks manner, in Rhat. ii. 2⁶. 8. he speaks ol tho Enthymemc
as including Example.
