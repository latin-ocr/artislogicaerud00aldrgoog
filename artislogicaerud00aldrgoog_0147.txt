hunc de minori, minorem de medio, h. e. medium

111. Syllogismis etiam adnumerantur aliae argu·
mentorum species3 quae nec stricte loquendo
syllogismi sunt, nec ita tamen peccant, ut prop-
terea mereantur excludi: in quibus scilicet reticetur

⁸ This objection is brought against Galen by AverroeS, on
daal. Post. Ι. 8. It might be better stated, majorem nugatorie
de seipso. Reokoning baokwards from the conclusion, we find
that the major contains the minor, tha minor the middle, tha
middle tha major; so that, in fact, tha major contains itsalf.

The fourth figure has been defended by Lambcrt, who
declares it to be useful for the discovery or exclusion 'of the
species of a genus. He frames a principle for it, called dr'atam
da reciproco. Ι. If no M is B, noB is this or that M (Ga-
menes). H. If 0 is or is not this or that B, there are B’s
which are or are notO. (Bramantip, Dimaris, Fesapo‚ Fresison.)
The principle is sufficiently clumsy; the utility questionable
For the syllogism is not an instrument of discovery ; and how
can we prove the species of a‘genus by a particular conclusion?
‘⁶ Some B is G,” only proves a separabis aecidmt. It may be
observed also, that tha objection which Lambert urges, and
with reason, against the conversion of the second and third
figures, viz. that by conversion we osten substitute an un·
natural and indirect for a natural and direct predication, does
not hold as regards the fourth. For, in the first three moods
no conversion of promises is needed. By regarding the first
stated aa the minor, the second as the major, we obtain a
much mora natural conclusion in tha first figure. Fesapo
and Fresison establish erraticas, and therefore, on Lambert’s
theory, should more naturally fall into tha third figure. The
whole distinction, however, between natural and annotarat

predication relatas to the matter, not to the form of the
thought.
