6. Fallacia Figurae dictionis, quando propter {ills

dictiones similes, quod de uno datur de allemanni.
arripitur: idque vel Grammatico& ut Musa est

¹ Grammatico, i. e. inserting that Poeta is of the feminine
genden because the majority of words with the same termi-
nation are so. Loqice, inferring that ridere belongs to the
category of ποιεῖν, because most infinitivo moods of this iorm
are included under it Thus viewed‚ it may be classed as in
dictione, because the rules os gender and conjugation are dil-
ferent in different languages.

But the more common form in which this Fallaoy would be
stated ie thet of an induction, or rather a number os examples,
alter the manner of Socrates. Indead, this very sophiam is
put into the mouth os Socrates by Aristophanes, Nubes,
681 sqq. Stated in this form, the logical inconsequence ie
obvious; as also if it is reduced to syllogism. ‘⁴ Such and
euch words are seminine; Musa resemblea euch and such
words.” Here there is no middle term. This ambiguity is
sometimes called multiplea pironrnrticum. of. Petr. Hisp.
Summ. Lug. Tract. vi. ‘⁴ Est autem multiplex phantasticum,
quando aliqua dictio significat unum et videtur significare
aliud, propter similitudinem quarn habet in parte oum alia
dictione ; ut uidem significat passionem, ot videtur significare
actionem, propter hoc quod est simile huic verbo, ogere.’' In
this form, it would seem more naturally to belong to the class
carra dictionem.

In Rhet. ii. tl. 2. Aristotle gives another form of this
Fallacy; viz. when a series ol detached propositione are so

enunciated as to appear logically connected, not being really
so. See also Soph. Elench. m. t.
