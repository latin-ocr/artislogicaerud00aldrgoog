Iu tho notes to Aldrich‘s account of Definition, I have
endeavoured to explain his languago in conformity with
the views most commonly found in Logioal Treatiscs.
But aa these vicus differ in many respects from those of
Aristotle‚'on which they are supposed to be founded, and
as a correct account of the doctrines of that l'lrilosopher
will materially assist in the solution of more than one
of those oeoeatae quoestiorres which are most perplexing
to beginners in Logic, l shall attempta somewhat fuller
exposition here. ’

In the second Book of tho Posteri-or Analytios‚ Aristotle
mentions three different forms of Definition, in the
following words: Ἔστιν ἄρα ὁρισμὸς εἷς μὲν λόγος τοῦ τί ἔστιν

ἀναπόδεικτος, οἷς δὲ συλλογισμὸς τοῦ τί ἔστι, πτώσει διαφέρων τῆς

ἀποδείξεως, τρίτος δὲ τῆς τοῦ τί loru ἀποδείξεως συμπέρασμα ⁸.
This passage is e concise summory of the whole Aristo-
telion theory of Definition. Adopting it as our text, we
proceed to comment as follows.

Α necessary preliminery to the determining the Real

Definition of any object, (vl losa) is to ascertain that such
object exists (ὅτι Ἔστι). Otherwise our Definition will
be merely a nominal onel. But we have two classes of
definable objects, of which the existence is determined
in two different ways, producing a corresponding variety
in the form of the Definition.
