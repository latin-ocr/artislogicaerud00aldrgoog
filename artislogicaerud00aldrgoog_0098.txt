‘Accidental definition is composed of genus and one or
more properties. Accidents properly so called are expressly
rejected as useless in definition by Porphyry, Isag. 8. 15. and
by Boethius, Opera, p. 3, though admitted by some subsequent
authorities Hence animat risibile would be a better example
than Aldrich's animal bipes implume. But the majority of
Logicians have very properly regarded accidental definition,
in any sorm, as no definition, but merely description. It does
not analyse the contents of a action, but enumerates marks
by which one individual may be distinguished from each other.
The same notion can have but one definitiom the same indi-
vidual may have many descriptione. Of. Albert. l. c. Occam‚

· Metaphysical definition‚ the only proper definition in the
strict sense ol the term, being by genus and differentia, (or
more correctly by genus and diffamatam see Top. i. 8, 3.
and supro, p. 24, note e.) it will follow, that all definable
notione must be species. Hence mmmc genna, which have no
differentiae, and individuale, which are distinguished only by
accidente, are not definable. See Arist. Metaph. iv. 3, 6.
(where for εἶς read οὐ, supported by two Mss. and by Alexander,
Schol. p. 693, a. 8.) vi. 15. 2. The supposed differencc on this
point between Aristotle and Locke, or rather Descartee, may
be reduced to a verbal question. See Appendix, note Ο.
