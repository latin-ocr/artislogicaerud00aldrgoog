Father Buffier is also entitled to honourable mention
among the French Logicians. In his Principes da
Raisonaemerrt, the rules of the syllogism are reduced to
a single principle, statueret ir ia the contained is ia the
containing. This formula, an important step towards
the true law of syllogism, the Principle of ldeutity, is
perhaps originally due to Leihnitz‘. Buffier has had
Ι the good fortune to receive high praise from two very
opposite quarters, and on very different grounds. He

has been celebrated, on the one hand, as one of the
earliest who attempted to found philosophy on certain
primary trutbS, given in certain primary sentimenta or
feelings3 and, on the other hand, as having advanced
some important steps in the direction of the sensa·
tiona'lism of condinae.

ι Le Clero, (Jaannes Clericus) the friend and disciple

of Loolre, published his Logia in 1692, three years after
the first edition of Locke’s Essay, of which he had
previously seen the Epitome. This work is principally
based on the views of Loeke, with some additions from
the Port Royal Logio‚ and the Recherche de la Verite
of Malebranohe. The fourth book, on Argumentation,
does not materially differ from the Aristotelian view3
though, like Looke, ha has not a high opinion of the
syllogism, and considers it to be mainly an instrument
of disputation. He adds a chapter on the Socratis
method of discussion, which he considers more valuable
than the Aristotelian syllogism, The Logio and Meta-
physics of ’S Gravesande, publisbed in 1736, is highly
praised by M. St. Hilaire, as simplifying with great
eleamess the ancient Logio‚ in connection with the
principles of Locke. The doctrines of Lache, modified
