a certain notion is predicable. For example, in the
Proposition, “'All men are mortal,’' we do not mean
that the conception Man includes Mortality, but that the
individuale possessing the attributes comprehended in
the former notion possess also those comprehended in
the latter.

In distinguishing a oermin portion of these Propo·
sitione as predicating Property, we must divest ourselves
altogether of the notiones necessary or contingent con·
nerino, and regard the word purely as a translation of
the Aristotelian ἴδιον. These Propositions essert, not
merely that certain objecta possess oemain attributes, but
that they alone possess them. This assertion, however,
is very imperfectly expressed in the ordinary form of the
affirmative proposition. The judgment, “all equilateral
triangles are equiangnlar‚” does not by its mere form
imply that all equiangular triangles are equilateral. This
knowledge is conveyed by the geometrical matter, not by
the logical form. To remedy this delect oi langnage‚ it
is necessary in a system of formal Logia to distinguish-
the propositione in which property is predicated from
, those in which accident is prediceted, by attaching an
universal sign to the predicate. “All equilateral triangles
are all equiangular,” will then denote that the predicate
is a property of the subject3 while “ all men are some
mortals,” distinguishes by the particular sign that the
predicate is an accident.

The distinction adopted by Aldrich between Property
and Accident, as necessarily or contingentby connected
with the subject, is untenable in formal Logia. If not
expressed in the copula, it implies the extralogioal
knowledge of a law of connection existing or not between
the objects signified by the terms; a law which cannot
be indicated in the symbolical formos the proposition.
