by (lartesianism bad also considerable influence on the
Logic of Wntts, in which a somewhat incongruons union
of Logia, Metaphysics, Psychology, and Educational
Precopts is put forth as the Art of using Reason well in

our inquiries after trutb, and the communication of it to
others.

The most important work on Logic from the school
of Leibnitz is the Philosophia Rationalis of Wolf, first.
published in lina. Wolf is regarded by Kont as the
representative of the dogmatic philosophy. Philosophy
with Wolf is the science ol things possible, sofar as
they are possible, and contains three principal branches,
Theology, Psychology, and Physics. The criterion ol
the possible is the principle of contradiction. Whatever
is not contradictory is possible ¹· Logia directa the
mind in the knowledge of all being ; its principles being '
drawn on the one side from Ontology, on the other
from Psychology. The Lapica Dooenr is defined by
Wolf as a Practical Scienca; the Lepino Utens as an
Art; the former· being acquired by reaching, the latter
by practice. The details of Wolls Logia are principally
Aristotelian, with one or· two ingenious but perverse
retinements. Thus, he reduces subaltern opposition to
a syllogism with an identical minor promise, and all
immediate consequences to abridged hypothetical syl·
logisrns. Induction he regards, like Archbishop Whately,
as a syllogism with the major promise suppressed. Wolf
is also the author of a smaller Logio in German, of
which there is a good English translation, published
1111770.

To the sarna school as Wolf belong Baumgarten and
Meyer. Baumgarten is highly praised by Kant for his
concentration of the Wolfian system. An annotated copy
