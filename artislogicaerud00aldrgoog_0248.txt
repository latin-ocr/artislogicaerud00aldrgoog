This method was a favourite with Plat03 it was rejected
as useless hy Speusippus ¹¹. Aristotle adopts an inter·
mediate course, limiting, however, its utility chiefly to
two pointS,-the right arrangement of tlie several parts
of the Definition, and the security that nothing essential
is omitted. It would thus seem to be useful‚ not so
much for discoveriup Definitions' as for testing them¹;
and even in this respect will he applicable only to ons
class of Definitions, that of Substances by genus and
differentiae.

For discovery, the second methodis employed. This
is commonly called the Inductive Method; a name, how·
, ever, not sanctioned by Aristotle himself¹. Itconsistsin
examining the several individuals of which the term to
be defined is predicable‚ and observing what they have
in common. If we can obtain one common notion, that
· is the Definition sought3 if not, the object of inquiry is
not one but many. This method is equally applicable
to Substances and to AttributeS, though Aristotle only
gives an example of the latter, the definition of mag·
nanimity, gained by examining into the actions of dif-
ferent magnanimous persons.

AnotherimportantremarlrofAristotle'sis,thatalthough,
as we have already seen, demonstration, in certain cases,

must always precede definition, yet no definition, as -

such, can he proved. This he maintains at some length
(against Xenocratesk), in Anal. Post. i. 4. and shews that

i This is perhaps marked hy Aristotle's own lauguage. In reference to -

the one method, he uses rcrccrwdsam to the other, ζητεῖν.
