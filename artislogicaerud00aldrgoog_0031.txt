one oi the first who applied Logia to Theology. Photius,
the learned and turbulent Patriarob of Constantinopla
in the uinth century, was the authores abridgments of Ι
the Categories and the De Interpretatione. Michael
Psellns the younger, in the aleventh century, composed
a Synopsis of the Cetegories and oi Porphyry's Intro·
ductionl. Tbc most remarkable work of this kind is
the Epitome Lepino of Nicephorus Blemmidaa, written
iu the thirteenth century, which contains the earliest
instance of that system of logical mnemonics which
the schoolrnen afterwards brought to such parientiam.
This list of Greek Logicians closae with the names of
George Pacbymeres of Constantinople, author of an
abridgment of the isagoge and the categories; and of
leo Megentinus, Metropolitan of Mytilene, author of an
Exegesis of the De Interpretatioue, principally taken
from Ammonius, and of Commentaries, some of which
are still unpublished. Το this list, some have added
the name of George cf Trebizoud3 but he, though a
Greek by birth, ia better known as a resident at Roma,
and, as an author, by his Latin translations and abridg-
ments of Aristotle. His name is rather connected with
a different phase of philosophy, with the Platonic and
Aristotelian controversias in the time oi Pope N ieholas V.
The progress oi Logia among the Latius presente in
one respect a contrast to that among the Greeks With
the latter, the age of abridgments and distinct treatises
followed that of commentaries3 with the former, it
preceded. The earliest work of a logical character in
Latin is the abridgment of Aristotle’a Topica by Oicer03
the object of which, however, ia rather rhetorical than
dialectical. This beatiss, which was written from

‘¹ The Synopsis cf the Organon attributedto Psellus is probably spurious.

questioned whether the Latin Logicians are indebted tc the Greek in this
respect See Sir W. Hamiltcn's Dameam, p. 126, 631⁸.
