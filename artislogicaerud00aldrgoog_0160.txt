⁸ The destructive syllogism is naturally reduced to the
second figure in the categorical form, and cannot in most
cases be brought to the first without considerable awkward-
ness. This may be avoided by conamine the hypothetical
before reductiou. A hypothetical proposition is converted by
Ooatraposittom thus, “ Il A is B, C ia D,'' to, “ Ii 0 is not D,

Hypothetical as well aa categorical reasonings may be

Logicians are at issue. The majority (Kant among the
number) regerd it as stating all possible cases: so that one
only of its members can be truc. lna Aquinas maintains
that any disjunctive proposition in which thie condition is not
observed, is falae. On thie supposition all the four inferentes
given by Aldrich are valid. But it may be questioned whether
the incompatibility oi the members appears in the som of
