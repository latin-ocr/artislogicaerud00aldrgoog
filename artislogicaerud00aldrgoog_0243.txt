There is also no warrant in Aristotle for limiting the
means by which Nominal Definition may be effected3
as is done hy those Logicians who specify synonyma and
etymologias. The latter method indeed seems to have
trespassed on the domuin of Logic from that of Rhetoric.
Nor has it the slightest connection with the former, save
by an ambiguity of language. The etymology will in nine
cases out of ten declare, not the present meaning of the
word, but either one that has become obsolete, or some
secondary notion, which may account for the imposition
of the name, but which at no time formed, strictly speak-
ing, itny part of its signification. This holds equally of
real objects and imaginary. It is only by an equivocation
that “boll-piercer’' can be assigned aa the meoniny of
“ centaur,’' or the notions of a swina and a quickset fonce
be combined into that of “hedgehog.”

Definition by synonym, on the other hand, may be ono
of the means of explaining the signification of a name;

' · though relatirely only, and from the occidental circum·
stance of one word being more familiar to the hearer

than another3 in which respect all translations from one
language into another are equally nominal definitione. Ἴ
It is not, however, specially mentioned by Aristotle⁸.
As a rear definitior a a obviously inrumpant, as a
neither assigns the cause of a phenomenon nor developes
the contents ofa notion.

The above dat-a will also furnish ns with an answer to
a question, which, lattcrly at least, has been a sore puzzle
to the tyro in Logic. What are the limits of Definition?
If all real Definiticn must be by Genus and Differentia,

⁸ Syncnyms ara expressly denied to be real Definitions in the proper
sense by Aristotle, Top. Ι. 5. 1. though admitted to be ὁρικά. As Nominal
Definitions, they are allowed by Alexander on Metaph. ri. 4. p. 442. ed.

Bcnitz; but the genuineness of this portion of the Commentary has been
questioned.
