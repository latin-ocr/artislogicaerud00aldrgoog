has both comprehensim and eaetenrion,· i. c. is a complex
uotion containing attributes, and is predicable of existing
objects. For its Predicate may either express a whole or
a partos the attributes comprehended in the subject, or
else some attribute not so comprehended‚ but possessed
by the objects of which the Subject is predicable. In
the latter case, where the Subject and Predicate are
distinct in comprehension, they may be either equal or
unequal iu extension.

The two first cases will correspond to the class of
Propositions called hy Kant‚ Aualytioal Judgments,
and by Mr. Mill, Verbcl Propositions. In these the
attributes composiug the Predicate are a part or the

whole of those composiug the Subject. They therefore
depend solely on the principle oi Identity. If Animal
forro part of the conception Man, the objecta, whether
actual or possible, thought under the latter must ueces-
sarily be identical with a portion of those thought under

the former.

To avoid the introductiou of new words, we may retain
the Aristotelian nomenclatura of Genus and Definition to
express the relation of Predicate to Subject in these two
classes of Propositions; though the former appellation‚
for the reason stated above, is not altogether free from
objections. Under Definition may be also included a
classus Propositions which are not iu the strict sense of
the word AnalytioalP aud are not admitted by Aristotlc
to he Definitions proper3 viz. those in which the Predicate
is a single term synonymous with the Subject.

The last two cases will correspond to the Synthetical
Judgments of Kant‚ and to the Real Propositions of
Mr. Mill. Iu these, the subjectis neither a word nor
a notion, but the several individua] things of which
