gorical and not reducible to it, being based on a different ·

Of this principle, as applied to judgmentS, Ι have
elsewhere remarhed, that it is not a lawof thought,but only
a statement of the necessity of some law or otheri. As
applied to syllogisms, it has the same character. It
states the fact, that whenever a copditicn, whether
material cause of a fact or formal reason cf a conclusion,
existS, the conditioned fact or conclusion exists also.
Thus viened, it is not the law of any distinct reasoning
procesS, but a statement of the conditione in which laws
of nature or of thought are operativa. When a material
cause existe, its material effect follows, and the pheno-
menon indicates a law of nature: when a logical premisc
is given, its logical conclusion folloWS, and the result
indicates a law of thought. What law, must in each
case be determincd by the particular features of the
phenomenon or reasoning in question ; buta statement
of this kind is distinguished from laws of thought,
properly so called, by the fact, that it cannot be ex· ,
pressed in a symbolical form: we require the introduction
of a definite notion, Causa, Recron, condition, or some·
thing of the kind, which is a special object of thought,
nottho general representative of all objects whatever.
The principle in question is thus only a statement of “
the peculiar character of certain matters about which we
may think, and not a law of the form cf thought in general.

Itis obvious that the relation of premises and con-
clusion in a syllogism may, like any other relation cf
condition and conditioned, be expressed in the form of
a hypothetical proposition: “ If all A is B, and all 0 is
