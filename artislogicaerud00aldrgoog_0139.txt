82 auris courum

“ Universaliter de alio, (i. e. de termino distributo)
“ sive affirmative, sive negative, praedicatur similiter

“de omnibus sub eo contentis.”

ὡσαύτως, An. Pr. il. 8. The same principle is implied in
the first antipredicamental rule, Categ. 3. l. ὅσα κατὰ τοῦ κατη-
γορουμένου λέγεται πάντα καὶ κατὰ τοῦ ὑποκειμένου ῥηθήσεται. Ῑυᾶθθᾶ,
Aldrich’s version is more nearly a translation oi the latter
than of the Dictum properly so called. Of. Petr. Hisp. Tract. iv.
“Dici de omni est, quando nihil est sumere sub subjecto, de
quo non dicatur praedicatum. Dici de nullo est, quando nihil
est sumere sub subjecto a quo non removeatur praedicatum.”

The Dictum dc Omm' ct Nullo is most improperly called a
Thcorcm. This term in Aristotle is synonymous with (impu,
and means a proposition, the truth of which is to be inquired
into, not one laid down as an axiom. See Topica, i. 11. 1.
Alexander, Scholia, p. 259, a. 88.

The dictum is directly applicable only to the first figure,
which is considered by Aristotle as the type of all syllogismo,
and to which the others have to be reduced, as a necessary
test oi their validity. In this he is followed by Kant, Lopilc,
ς. 69. Other logicians enunciate distinct axioma sor the
second and third figures. This has been done by Lambert,
Neues Ocycmm, part i. ch. 4. 5. 232. but he is far from happy
in his enunciation of the dicta. We may state them as follows,
in a somewhat improved form.

Principle of second figure. Dictum dc Diverso.

lfa certain attribute can be predicated (affirmatively or
negatively) of every member of a class, any subject, of which
it cannot be so predicated, does not belong to the class⁸

Principles of third figure. Ι. Dictum dc Exemplo.

Ifa certain attribute can be affirmed ol any portion of the
members of a alasa, it is not incompatible with the distinctive
attributes of that class.

Il. Dictum dc Ecccpto. Ila certain attribute can be denied
of any portion of the members ola class, it is not inseparable
from the distinotive attributes of that class.

The natural use of the second ligure, according to humbert,
