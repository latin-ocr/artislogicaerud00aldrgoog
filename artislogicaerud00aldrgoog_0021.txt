to the colloquial form, which, whether in solitary medi-
tation, or in conversation with others, Plato regarded as
the true methodos eliciting and communicating know·
ledge¹¹; a view intimately connected with his doctrine
of ideas, and with the theory which placed all knowledge

in reminiscente. The Dialectic oi Aristode holds a far a

lower position, being merely the act oi disputing by
question3 of attacking and defending a giren thesio
from principles of mere probability, such as the opinions
of men in general, or oi tho majority, or oi certain
eminent authorities The Dialectieal Syllopa'am is thus
the same as the Loqtcal,· and tlre names Logic and
Dialectia if used solely in conformity with Aristotle's
authority, would correspond, not to the Organon as a
whole, but only to the two last treatiseS, the Topics and
Sophistic Refutatiorrs0.

Thus much may suffice, as regards the origin aad use
os the name Logic and the cognate terms. More im-
portant is the inquiry, tc what extent the science itself,
as exhibited in Aristotle, is indehted to the labours oi
previous philosophers. Dialectic‚ the thing though pro·
bably not the name, is regarded,=on the authority oi
Aristotle, as the invention of Zeno the Eleaticr. By this
is probably only meant that Zeno was the first to employ
dialogue asthe medium of philosophical instruction3
his predecessore of the same school, Xenophanes and
Parmenides, having communicated their doctrines in
verse. The dialectic method was afterwards exten-
sively used by different schools, and for different pur-
poses, which ultimately obtained distinctiva names.
