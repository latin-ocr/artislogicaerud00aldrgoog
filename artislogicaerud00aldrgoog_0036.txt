tatione display of logical art than has been usual at
other periods. But the applicatione of Logia to reason-
ings on this or that branoh of material scienoe have
nothing in thern which is more peculiarly the property
of the Sehoolmen thau of any other reasouers. The
Lopioo atam is one arrd the same to all generations of
men; all who reason soundly, reason eonsciously or
unoonsciously by logical lawe, and the open display of
the instrument in nse does not melre it a distinct in-
strument from that which others employ in a ruore
aoueealed manner.

Ahistorioal aooount of the Scholastio Logio ought
therefore to conflue itself to commentaries and treatises
expressly 011 the soienoe; arrd the scholastio oontri-
butions to the matter of Logia should ba oonfined to
anah additions to the Aristotelian text as hare been
inoorporated into the Lopioo άοοοηε. Iu this reapeot
the Sehoolmen did muah ιο fix the teehnioal terme of
the saiance, particularly in rospeet of the relation of
thought to language. Most of the distinetione of the
different uses and significatione of worda are due to
them ;-—distinetions, however, aarried to au useless and
wearisome minuteness in the grammatieal subtleties of
the parvo bpieolr'a. They also contributed considerably
to that whioh is most wanting iu Aristotle, au exeat
eonoeption of the nature and offioe of Logio; though
their definitione were not always consistent with the
rest of their treatment; the text of Aristotle being
seldom modilied to suit the theory of the soienee. But
the most remarkable contribution of this period is to
be found in that singular system of logical mnemouioa
by which, from the time of Petrus Hispanus, nearly all
the forms and praeesses of Logia might be learned by

rote and performed almost mechanically, by the aid of ¹

a memorial word or line. The oontroversy between the
