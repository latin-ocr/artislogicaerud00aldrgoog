to reduce Induction to Syllogism, in the strict sense
of the term, must commence by inverting the whole
operati0n3 stating as a preliminary assumption that
which is really the conclusion of the Inductive process.
lt moreover leaves ns no alternative between converting
mere empirical judgments into self-evident axioms, or
destroying the whole foundation of reasoning‚ by com·
mencing with a Syllogism whose premises themselves
must be proved by another Syllogism‚ and so on ad
infinitam.

Thc Aristotelian Induction proper has been described
'as an analyticol, its connterpart, Syllogism, as a ayn·
ttetieat process3 aud the two have respectively been
identified with the >dyst tal τὰς ἀρχὰς and ἀπὸ τῶν ἀρχῶν
of Aristode ¹². And this is in one sense correct, though,
according to a various notion of whole and part, the
terms Analysis and Synthesis have perpetually been
interchanged with each other. According as vve loolr to
the comprehensim, or to the aeterniora of the notione, we
may regard the Genus as a part of the Species, or the
Species as a part of the Genus. Hence the notione of
Synthesis'and Analysis, of the composition of parts into
awhole, and the resolution of a whole into parts, will,
as vve adopt the one or the other point of view, be
inverted. We have previously spoken of Induction as
an inference from the constituting parts to the con·
stituted whole. ln this respect it is apelletiani, the parts
and whole being viewed in their logical or cetensioael
relation. In the same point of view, the Platonic
methodos division is sometimes called analytical ¹. On
the other hand, in the ordinary modern use of the terms,
induction is analytical, adopting the metaphysical relation
of part and whole as simpler or moro complex notions.
