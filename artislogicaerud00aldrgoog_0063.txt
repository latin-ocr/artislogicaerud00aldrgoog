appelle rononner l'aotion de notre esprit, par laquelle il forme
un jugement de plusieurs autres.''

of this division ol the operatione of the mind, Sir W.
Hamilton has observed, that “it never was proposed as a
psycbolopicol distribution of the cognitive faculties in penerel:
but only as a logicat distributiones that section of them
which we denominate discursive, as those alone which are
proximately concerned in the process ol reasoning.” Reid’s
Worlra p. 943, 899. Hence Aristotle's division, which is
psycbolopicol, will not exactly correspond. The nearest ap·
proach to Simple Apprehension is ἦ τῶν ἀδιαιρέτων νοήσεις
but νοήσας is variously used, anrl in its widest sense will
*embrace all the logical operatione and even φαντασία, which
belongs rather to the perceptive soul. See de Animo, iii.
3. 8. Judgment will correspond nearly to the ιάιαἌηψις of de
Aa. iii. 3. 7. (cf. Trendelenburg Arist. dedeima, p. 469.)
The latter term however is inapplicable to the cognition of
axiomatic truths. Discursus answcrs to διάνοια and λογισμός,
the former term being applied both to the faculty and its
operation. But there is much uncertainty in the use of all
the above terma cf. Biese, vol. i. ρ. 89, 397. Hamilton’s
Reid, p. 768.

¹The service supposed to be performed by Logia in
relation to these three defects is more fully and clearly stated
by Burgersdyck Inst. Lep. l. ii. c. l. “Mens nostra qna·
