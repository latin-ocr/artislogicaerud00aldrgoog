are at issue, whether they are to be regarded as nominal,
or as imperfect real definitione. The question is of the
less importance, inasmuch as Aristotle elsewhere con-
demns the use of such defiuitions altogether¹. The
weight of authority is perhaps with the latter interpre-
tation. But, judging merely from the text of Aristotle,
the former seems far simpler and more natural'.

From the abore statement it would appear that Nominal
Definiticn, according to Aristode, is one irr which there
is no evidence of the existence of objects to which the
definiticn is applicable. In form it need not necessarily
differ from a Real Definition. There may be a quasi-
genus and a quasi-difference, as if we defined a centaur,
“ an animal with the upper parts of a man and the lower
parts of a horse;” but, until we have ascertaiued the
existence of creaturas possessing these characteristica,
the definiticn is only one cf the signification of a name¹.

² Of the former opinion are Averroes and Zabarella, who are followed by ’
M· st. Hilaire in his Translation of the Organon. The latter is maintained
by the Greek Commentators, by Pacius, and in the recent Essays by
Rassow and Kiihn.

¹ See De Anima, ii. 2. 2.

1 The decision partly depends on the interpretation of a doubtful
passage, Anal. Post. ii. 8. 4. τὸ δ’ εἷ ἔστιν dri μὲν κατὰ συμθεβηκδς ἔχομεν,
tet δ’ ἔχοντές τι αὐτοῦ τοῦ πρόγαατος. The instances which follow may
refer either to the one or the other.

¹ It may be questioned whether the name Nominal Definition is sanc-
tioned by Aristotle. Trendelenburg indeed (Elementa, ξ. bd.) so reuders
the λόγος dreituraias of An. Post. ii. 10. l. and the interpretation, if correct,
would seem to shew that Nominel, as well as Real Definitions must be
sentences ,· but the context, λόγος τοῦ τί σημαίνει τὸ tropat λόγος ἕτερος
inoperatus, seems rather to mean, “a sentence explanatory of the signifi-
cation of a name, or of another sentence having the force of a name.’' On
the other interpretation, the word ἕτερος is superfluous, and the example,
olor τὸ τό σημαίνει rl ἐστιν ᾗ τρίγωνον, unintelligible. By λόγος όνοματῶδης
is therefore meant a sentence whose signification, like that of asingle noun,
is one. Such are all real Definitions, of which the example is a specimen.
See De Int. ὁ. 2. Metaph. vi. 4. 16. vi. 12. 2. vii. 6. 2. Alex. Schol. p. 748.
a. at. In the Greek Commentators, on the other hand, λόγος deoneratas
is clearly used for Nominal Definition. See Philop. Schol. p. 244. b. 31.
