ΟΝ EXAMPLE AND tunicor.

Excussa is defined by Aristotle, “proving the major
term of the middle by a term resembling the minor ·.”
This definition is obscure, from being worded so ss to
contrast with his definition of Induction, in which the
major term is proved of the middle by the minor. It
does not apply to the singular conclusion ultimately
established, but to the universal proposition which forms
the conclusion of the inductiva portiones the Example.
Thus, if we expand Aristotle’s instance into its complete
form, composed of an imperfect inducticn and a syllos
giam, it will run thus:

The war ol the Thebans and Phccians (D) was 'an

evil (A),
The war of the Thebans and Phocians was e war between
neighbours (B), ¹
All wars between neighbours are evil.
A war between the Atheniens and Thebans (Ο) is a war
between neighbours‚
Itis an evil.

In this reasoning there are four terms, Athe major, B the
middle, 0 the minor, D the ὁμοῖον. The definiticn applies
to the third proposition, in which A is proved of Β by
means of D. If the final conclusion were talren into
account, the Example might be more correctly defined
as a reasoning in which the major term is proved of the
minor by means of a middle, of which middle the major
hasbeen proved by a term resembling the minor.
