axiomata, descendendo ad opera.” Reasoning, accord-
ing to Hohbes, is computation, the adding and sub-
tracting of our thoughts and of their signs. Apro-
position is but the addition oi two names, and a
syllogism the adding together of three. In a proposition,
two names are so coupled together, that he that speaks
conceives both to be names oi the same thing3 from
whence it follows that trnth and falsehood consist only
in speech, and thot the first truths were arbitrarily
made by those who first imposed names on things. A
full criticism of this doctrine would exceed my present
limits. l ean only observe that the main error of Hohbes
does not lie, as is sometimes said, in his theory of notioris,
but in that ofjndgmerrts. He has overlooked the fact,
that apprehension is primarily the analysis ci judg-
ment, not jndgment the synthesis of apprehensione

The Bacenian influente is also manifest in Gassendi,
the friend of Hohbes and the antagonist of Descartes.
Lilre HohbeS, he describes reasoning as a computation,
and he anticipates Condillac in traoing all knowledge
to sensation. He adopts the fourfold division of Logia,
into Apprehension, Judgment, Reasoning, and Method,
which had virtually been invented by Ramns and
accepted by the Semi-Ramists, and which was shortly
afterwards adopted by the Port Royal Legio. He
admits two figures only of Syllogism, an affirmative
and a negative, (answering to the affirmative and nega·
tire moods of the first figure in Aristctle;) and it is wortliy
of remark, that in the order of the premise5‚ he retnms
to the arrangement of the Greek LogicianS, (the reverse
of that of the Latina) and places the minor before the
major. His theory of reduction, by which he brings every
syllogism ostensively to his two figureS, contains some
ourions blunders
