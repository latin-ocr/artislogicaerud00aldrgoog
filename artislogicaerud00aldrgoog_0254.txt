the proof may be given iu Oategorioal Syllogisms. In
· others, it is far more naturally exhibited in the hypo·
thetios] form. The assumption of a hypothetioal premise
will always present the reasoning in alogioally valid,
though not always in the most natural, form; and it is
frequently the only materially allowuble assumption in
oases where the given antecedent and consequent bave
both terme distinet. E. g. A is B, therefore O is D. We
may supply, IfA is B,G is D; but to determine the trutlr
of the assumed proposition, whether it be hypothetioel
or oategorioal, does not fell within the province of the
Logioian.

Among these material, and therefore extra-logioal,
Consequenoes, are to be olassed those whioh Reid
adduees as esses for whieh Logia does not provide 3
e. g. “Alexander was the son of ‚Philip,” therefore
“Philip was the father of Alexander ;” “Ais greater
than B,‘' therefore “B is less than A.’' In both these it
is our material knowledge of the relations “ father and
son,'’ “greater and less,'‘ that enables us to malie the
inferenee.

Another of Reid’s examples is the following: “A is

equal to B, and B is equal to Ο, therefore Ais equal
· to 03⁹ This reasoning is elliptioal, and therefore, aa it
alaude, material, though owing to the suppressed premise
being sels-evident, its defieienoy is apt to be overlooked.
Stated in logieal form, the syllogism runs thus:

Things that ere equal to the same are equal to each other;
A and Ο ore equal to the same,
Therefore A and Ο are equal to each other·.

Another example of the same kind is that sometimes
oalled reasoning a fortiori. Ε. g. “A is greater than B,
