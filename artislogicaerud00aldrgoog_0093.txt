more resembles division proper; as the name and definition of
the whole are predicable os each part. But on account os the ·
infinite number ol individuale, and consequent impossibility
of exhausting the species, this is not generally reckoned as a
division proper.

The division of an equivocal term, as conis into attineat,
sidua, piscis, is sometimes called Distinctioa. The test of this
is, that the name is predicable of each member, but not the
same definitiou. This is uselul for separating the senses of
an ambiguous term before defining it. See Top. vi. 2. 1.

¹ For the due observance of these rules, it ia desirable that
the divisione consist of as few members as possible. Some
recommend dichotomy, or a division ol every genus into two
species by means ol opposed differentiae. Ol the four kinds
of Opposition, Boethius admits for this purpose contraries,
positive and privative tennS, and also contradictorios as some-
times unavoidable; but rejects relatives. Aristotle censores
the use of privative and indefinite terme, and approves of
division by contraries. (See Top. vi. 6. 3. de Part. Anim. i. 3.)
Here dichotomy is only practicable when the contraries admit
no medinm between them. of. Cat. lo, 18. Top. vi. 6. 1.
Examples of dichotomy by contraries may be found in the
Arbor Porphyriana. Fora threelold division of the same kind,
See Eth. Nic. vii. 6, ὅ. τῶν γὰρ ἡδέων ἔνια φύσει αἱρετά, τὰ δ’ ἐναντία
τούτων, τὰ δὲ μεταξύ. Dichotomy by contradiction, which Aristotlc
censuros, had been a favourite method with Plato, as it after-
wards was with Remus and his followers. See Hamilton's
Reid, p. 689. Ol. Trend. Elem. ᾗ. 68. Erlauterungen, p. 106.

But none of the above methods of division can be regarded
as a strictly formal process of thought. Any concept A is
