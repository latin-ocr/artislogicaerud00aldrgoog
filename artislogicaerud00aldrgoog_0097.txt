Ρ Physical definitionis rejected by Aristotle, (Metaph. vi.
ll.) on the ground that the physical parts are not parts of the
speclea, but ol the individuale. Aldrich's expression, “partes
eucrotia physicas,‘’ cannot be tolerated unless we regard univer·
sal notions as not merely real substantes, but corporeal. In
the example given by alerien, the socelled Physical definition
may be regarded as merely an indirect mode of expressing
the same notion that the Metaphysical definition expresses
directly. Itis thus merely an accidental variation os lan-
guage‚ easily reduced to the direct form, and is so regarded
by Albert, de Praed. Traot. i. ohap. 6. and by Oetam, pt. i.
ch. 26. In all other cases it is no definition at all.

‘¹ Most Logicians reokon two principal methods of
nominal definition: 1. by a synonymous term, e. g. “ensis
est gladius :” 2. by Etymology‚ as in Aldrich's example.
The former is in lact translation, it being indifferent whether
the synonyma belong to the same language or not; the latter
will in many cases be no definition at all; alarge number of
words having quite lost their etymologica] meaning. Neither
ol' these methods is countenanced by Aristotle ; see Appendix,
noteG. The former may he traoed tothe Greek Commentators;

see Alexander, in Metaph. p. 442. ed. Bonitz. The latter is an -

innovation horrowed from the RhetoricianS, hy whom it was
called Notatio. See Cicero, Top. ch. 8.,

“ In Mathematioa and in all strict Sciences,'’ says Abp.
Whately, the Nominal and the Real Definition exaotly coin-
cide; the meaning of tlte word, and the nature oftbe thing,
being exactly tlte auuw.” This remark is based on Locke ;
(Euty, b. iii. e. 3. ξ. 18.) but it eonsounds the Real Essenoe
ol Locke‚ i. e. the unknown constitution of each iadictdaal

with the Loqical Essence or contents of natuerat notiora. cf.
Zabarella De Methodici, l. i. p. 159.
