position simply convertible. This is requisito, in order
to comply with the condition of qnatenus ipsam.

This Dernonstration is exceedingly satisfactory, if we
are only allowed to assume all the conditione on which
its validity depends3 viz. l. that risibility does flow as
an effect from rationality as a cause; 2. that the major
premise, in which this causation is asserted, is an
axiomatis principle, cognoscible a priori, and, as such,
carrying with its cognition, the conviction of necessity;
3. that the conclusion is not a mere repetition, in dif-
ferent wordS‚ of the rnajor premise3 horno and cainani
rationale being identical; 4. that any Demonstration
aclrnowledged to be ralid can bc resolved into the above
form.

But waiving the consideration of these questions,
which are more easily asked than answered‘, we may
find a simplet way of testing the demonstratio potissimo,
by going back to the original authority. For Aristotle's
examples are principally taken, as is natural, from the
Mathematics; and it is to aGeornetrical theorem that the
tests of aad αὑτό and ᾗ αὐτό are expressly appliedl. (lan it
be believed, then, that Aristotle regarded the following
as a correct analysis of Geornetrical Demonstration?

Every rectilinear figure of three sides has its angles equal
to two right angles;

Every triangle is a rectilinear figurc of three sides; therefore

Every triangle has its angles equal to two right angles

s‘sSi scrupulosius inquiratur in rem hanc; Num qua sit essentialis
connexio inter rationalitatem et risibilitatem, quo sit eaproprta causo hujus,
seu cansa per se; ut· Rationalitas, propter ipsam sui Essenttom, non possit
esse absque Risibilitste; neque haec absque illa: et qudem incendiato,
absque interventu alius considerationis qua connectatur; atque adaquata,
ut ad omnes rationales extendatur atque ad hos solos: subtilior forsan
esset inquisitio quam ut ei facile satisfiat.” Waffis, Log. lib. 3. cap. 22.
