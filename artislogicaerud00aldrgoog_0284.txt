ΟΝ THE HYPOTHETICAL SYLLOGISM.

ΤΗΔΤ the συλλογισμοὶ if invidetne of Aristotle are u'ot ·

identical with those which, since the time oi Theophrastus
and Eudemus, have been received in Logic as Hypothe·
tical Syllogisms, is now generally admitted& The word
Hypotltetical is never by Aristotle opposed to Cate-
90rical, but to ostensive (δεικτικὸςδ); and he remarks that
the Syllopiste'c portion oi the reasoning in Hypothetical

Syllogisms is ostensive, and requires no reduction3 but
that the determination of the original question is not
effected by Syllogism at all, and cannot be exhibited in
Syllogistic form. The meaning of this may be clearly
explained by examples.

Of the Hypothetical Syllogism, two principal kinds are
mentioued by Aristotle. One is the ἀπαγωγὴ εἰς si ἀδύνατονι

the otherisaSyllogism ofwhich theconclusivenessdepends
entirely on agreement between two contending parties,
and which is therefore chiefly serviceable in dialectic
disputation. The latter may be exhibited as follows.

The original question being to prove that some A is
not B3the contending parties agree to the hypothesis,
that if some A is not 0, it is not B. The reasoning
proceeds thus‘:

No X is 0 ;
All X is Α; (συλλογισμὸς ἐξ ὑποθέσεως.)
Therer‘ore, Some A is not G.

And then, in consequence ostie precinas agreement, bnt
not os tlte Splhpism, it is allowed that some Ais not B.

⁸ We must except Μ. St. Hilaire, who professes to discover the ordinary
Hypotheticels in Auel. Prior, i. 44. 1. But the text of Aristone will hardly

warrant the assertion.
l See Auel. Pr. i. 23. 2.
