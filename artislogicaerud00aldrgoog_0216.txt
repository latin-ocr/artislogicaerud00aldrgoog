ΟΝ THE cenomantico.

In has been already ohserved that the ordinary
logical account of the Predioahles, even in its least
objectionable form, as it occurs in the isagoga of Pcr-
phyry, cannot be consistently maintained, except upon ,
Realist principles. By this is meant, that there are

porticus of that account altogether untanahle, except on
the supposition that Genera and Species are not mere
conceptione of the humen mind, but hava en independent
existence in Nature. Whether they are to be regarded
as existing separetely, es in the Platonic theory of ideas,
or in the individuale, according to the view sometimes
attributed tc Aristotle, (for both these opinions had their
advocates among the Schcolmen⁸,) is in this respect
immateria13 though it may be observed hy the way, that
of tha various modificatione to which Realism has at
different times been subjeoted, the Platonis hypothesis
is hy far the most consistent and intelligihlc. The

¹ Both were early, almost simultaneous‚ developments cl the scholastio
Realism, appearing as soon ss the Nominslism ol Roscelin compelled the
antagonist doctrines to assume a definite form. The Platonis theory was
advocated by Bernsrd ol Ohartres3 ths other, ultimately the prevsiling
doctrine, lound its earliest scholastio supporter in William cl champeaux.
