between σημεῖον and ὁμοίωμα, see Waitz. vol. i. p. 324.

Ρ What Aldrich calls simply Voc, is called by Aristotle peri
σημαντικὴ, and byBoethius and PetrusHispanus, Vocaipnificatiou
ad placitam. ln the latter case, Voe is extended to the gram·
matical word; in the former, it is limited to what may be called
the Voc Lopico. Logic differs from Grammer, in considering
language simply as the interpretation of thoapbt, (the ἑρμηνεία of
Aristode) not as in any way expressive of the passions or the
will. Logic therefore solely regards words as the signs of an
operation of the reason, and hence its simplest words are the
noun and the verb, which alone are per ee signs of conceptione.
syncategorems, being not significative but consignificative,
are excluded from Logic, but recognised by Grammar. So
Aristode, in the De Interpretatione, treats only of the noun

. and the verb. In the Poetics, ch. 20. he adds the φωναὶ ἄσημοι,
the conjunction and the article. cf. Harris, Hoerner, eh. iii.
On the distinction between the logical and the grammatical
proposition, some good remarks will be found in Du Marsais,
Principes de Graecanica, p. 321.

q Suppetit pro re. 'l'he supportica (as it was called) of a
term being posterior to its signification. The doctrine of the
suppositiones terme, which is not found in Aristotle, is one
of the subtleties of the paroc lopiculiu, a scholastic addition to
the Organon, rather grammatioei than logical. Suppositio
was defined to be ⁴‘ Acceptio termini substantivi pro aliquo;”
thus the term bomo, naturally applicable to men of all
generations, is, in the proposition demarcuit, accidentally
limited to existing individuals. In this case it was said, in
not very classica] Latin, “homo supponit pro praesentibus.n
For further information on the various kinds of supposition,

the curicus reader may examine Sanderson's Logic, b. ii.
