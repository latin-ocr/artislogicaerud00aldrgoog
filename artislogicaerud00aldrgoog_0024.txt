ii examined by searching questions, they are like written
bools, unable to replyv. ln the same spirit, lile Des-
oartes in modern times, he urges the necessity oi o.
purification ol the mind from prejudioe and false opinions,
as a necessary preliminary tc the investigation ol truth;
the principol meant of purification being Dialectic ¹.

In all this, es well ts in the Dialectic oi Plato, wc find
nc anticipaticn of any important part of the Aristo-
telian Anslyti03 though the various modificatione of the
dialectio form may hare contributed more or less to that
systematized methed of disputation exhibited in the
two last treatisea ol the Orgenon. The antecedente of
Aristode's mere strictly logical labours appear in other
und more subordinate points cf the philosophy of his
predecessore We may pass over, as unquestionably
surgeries of a loter period, the Cetegories attributed to
Archytas, ond the other logical relies oi the Pythagoream
school·. There romain two important logical dis·
coveries attributed by Aristotle to Socrates, Induction
und Definiticnl. The Induction, however, of Socrates
Ἴ is not, like thot of Aristotls, a strictly formal process
of reasoning t'rom the aggregate of particulare to the
universal constituted by them. lt rather resemblcs the
Aristotelian Exemplo cr Pareble⁰‚ being a material
inicrence from u selected number of similar -or anologous
cases to another individual instance under discussion.
As o specimen, may be taken the following argument
from the Gorgias. ΣΩ. Τί οὖν; ί τὰ τικτονιιιὰ μιμαίηκιίς
τικτωικίς, b ὥς ῙῸΡ. Ναί. m. Οὐκοῦν καί ί τὰ μουσικὰ

dsmrlbed, though Socrates is not the speaker.
