l. Attributcs, under which term ere included all things
belonging to any other Cetegory than thet of Substonce.
These exist only in Substences as their subjecte, and
their existence is properly determined by Demonstratioffl.
When ascertained in any other wey, we are said to know
it only accidentally ⁶. In the Demonstratire Syllogism,
the minor term is the Subjeot, the major the Attribute;
the Ceuse, by virtue of which the Subject is thus affected,
being the middle term. When by suche Syllogism we
bare proved thet all Ais B, we know that the attribute
B exists in the subject A.

II. Substances, which exist not in tt Subjeot, but per
cer. Of such the existence cannot be proved, but must
be assumed, before any of their Attributes can be demon·
streted. This assumption, under the name of Hypothesie,
forms one of the Aristotelian ἄρχα1, or Principles of
Science, which must precede ell Demonstration s.

‘ Hence the Scholastic maxim, decidentis esse etl inesse. Cf. Aquinas,
Opusc. xlviii. de Syll. Demonst. ch. ll. I heve preferred the term Attri-
bute to decident, inlesmueh es the letter is frequently approprieted in a
special sense to such Attributes es exist only contingently, end ere therefore

indemonstreble.
