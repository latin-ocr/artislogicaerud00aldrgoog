Α few words in conclusion on the origin of the name
Enthymeme. That its etymology is to be found in ἓν
aud θυμὸς, ie undeniable3 but only in the same degree as
is olso true of ἐνθυμεῖσθαι, ἐνθύμιος, and other oognate terms.
But that it has no special referenoe to a promise in tlte
mind, is evident3 firstly, beoause θυμὸς ἱη the Aristotelian
phraseology is not “the mind,‘’ and has nothing to do
with the expression or suppression of premises; secondly,
beoause the word ἐνθύμημα ooeurs in writers earlier than
Aristode, and before it oould hare assumed its teehnieal
meaning. To ascertain the true derivation, however, is
not so easy as to refute a palpably absurd one. If,
however, we were eompelled to make a suggestion, the
following, though not oonfidently put forwerd, has at
leest the meritos not being positively ridieulous. Ae·
eording to the analogy of words of the same termination,
such us Φιλοσόφημα, ἐπιχείρημα, σόφισμα, dte. ἐνθύμημα will
properly signify the result of an aot of reflection¹¹. Hence
it is used by Sophocles for a thonpht supported hya person
or thing⁰, and by Xenophon? for a plan deriyned, opposed
to ἔργον, tte execution. The term is thus naturally enough
applicable to the snppeetione or persuasioe orpnntenta of
Rhetorie, as distinguished from the demonstratione of
Seienee.

¹¹ cf. Melenohthon, Erotem. Diat. p. 187. Enthymema signifieat cogita.
tionem seu quiddam cogitatum, ut nos dicimus Ein Bedenten.
