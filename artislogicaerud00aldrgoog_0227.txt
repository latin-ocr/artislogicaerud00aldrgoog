If, on the other hand, a special form oi the copula is
adopted, and Property and Accident distinguished hy the
expressions, A mart he B, A moy be B, the classificatiou
becomes οο longer applicahle to the pure form of the
proposition, sud requires the introduction of the extra-
logical doctrine of Modnitya The adoption of a
quantified predicate, on the other hand, is 0 necessary
step when language is designed to express the pure form
of thought, sud every classificatiou of logical forms should
be adopted to this condition ¹.

In the foregoing remarks, Genus and Definition ex-
press a relation of notions to notions, Property and
Accident, one of attributes to things. Hence it will follow
that notions purely imagiusry, i. 0. confessedly predicable
of no objects existing elsewhere than iu the mind, can
only, as such, be the subjects of analytica] judgments·
Proper names, on the other hand, having 00 0000000, 000
only be the subjects of synthetical judgments. The
former have no Properties or Accideuts3 the latter have
·no Genus or Definition.

Species is excluded from the Predicables, and contined
to the Species Sah'icihilis, the correlative of the Predicahle
Genus. By this we avoid 00 inconsistency of which the
majority of Logicians are guilty, in employing the term
Species sometimes to express a relation of a Predicate
to a Subject, sometimes that of a Subject 00 0 Pre-
dicate. Το0 so-called Species Proedicabiiis, is, in the
manner of its predication, in no way distinguishable
from Genus. Mac, when predicated of philosopher,
expresses a part only of the essence of its subject, i. e.
a portion of the attributes which the subject notiou
