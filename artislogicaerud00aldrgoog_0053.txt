the subsequent Logic oi Germauy. It is true that
the two greatest of his immediate successors, Fichte and
Schelling, have produced no direct logical worlr3 and
hare openly expressed their low estimato of the science0.
But a host of able writers· have notwithstanding arisen,
as numerous as the Logiciaus of the sixteenth end seven·
teenth centurias, to promulgate, to correct, or to oppose
the Kantiau Logic. Some of these, as Hollbauer and
Kiesewetter, adhere for the most part to the Kantian
limite. Others, as Krug and Fries, are mainly Kantion,
though they have materially enriched the science from
their own resources3 aud the latter has especially noticed
the wantos a psychological relation, astho main deiect
of Kant’s system. The most eminent name among the
strictly forunal Logicians since Kant is Herbart3 but both
he aud his disciple Drobisoh have pushed to an extreme
Kant's error in an exclusively d priori view of the
science.

On the other haud, the Logic of Hegel reconstructs from
the opposite side the metaphysical fabric which Kant
had overthrowu. After the Kantion Urbique, it was
impossible to bring a philosophy of the Absolute
within the received compass of human thought: there
remained only the attempt to expeud thought to the
immensity of the object, by a gigantic scheme oi Intel-
lectual Pantheism, in which the personal consciousness
and its limits should be absorbed in the proeesses of the
one lnfinite Mind. Such is the fundamental principle of
tha Logic of Hegel, a Logic constructed‚ not in obe·
dieuce to, but in defiance of, the laws of thought, which
are held to be valid only for the finite understanding

² Fichte, in his “Vorlesungen ueber das Verhaltnias der Logik zur
Philosophie,¹' altogether repudiatas the ordinary Logic to make way for
a hanscendental system, and complains that this was not sufficiently done
by Kant. Schelling in his “Brund' holds the same view. ‘Welche Hoff-
nuug zur Philosophia hir den, welcher sie in der chik sucht? Kaine.”
