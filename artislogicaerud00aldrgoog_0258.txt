And even in respect of principles allowed to be in·
ductive‚ the actual previous assumption 01 every possible
instance ie not necessarily implied. And it ie here that
an able defenderet 1110 Syllogiem, Mr. Mill, has taken 0
low and inadequate ground, a ground too, inconsistent
with his own subsequeut analysis 01 1110 process 01
Induction. His defence in 1001 amounts 10 00 abandon-
ing of 011 formal reasoning. All reasoning,he 10110 ue,
is really 11001 particulare to particulare. But in 11101
0000, 011 101010οο0 must depend upon the matter, and
. cannot be reduced to any general type. Ι1, 101 example,
Ι conclude that the Duke 01 Welliugton ie 1001101, solely
from the premisee, “ John, Thomas, &a are mortal, and
the Duke 01 Wellington resembles these in certain other
attributes ;‘’ I might, by an argument 01 precieely the same
form, prove him to be a 11000110001100011001101100000000
1110 attributes 01 humbuity in common with certain given
individuale 0111101 001100.

This portion 01 the question resolves 110011 1010 the
following. What do we mean when we essert that 011
men are mortali Is it merely a concise mode 01 etatiug ·
that Socrates and Plato possess this attribute, in 00011000
with a number 01 other individuale, quor 1111110 perscribere
1011911111 ert? Ι1 so, to argue, “Socrates is one 01 the
individuale above mentioned, therefore 110 10 mortal,”
is, 11 001 0 11099109 01 1110 question, at least a needless
repetition 010 previous statement.

But, in 1001, 1110 Univereal Proposition means no such
thing. It means that, by virtue 01 0 certain established
law, certain attributes, or groups of attributes, are always
00 united, that in whatever individuale we find 1110 000,
110 may look upon them 00 00 infallible mark 01 the
other. Α 0001101100 01 11110 kind however, as it cau
