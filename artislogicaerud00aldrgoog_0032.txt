nrenrory, differs in many respeots oonsiderahly fronr the
original. After (linaro, we lind nothing bnt a few
allusione to the subjeot in Quintilian end Aulus Gellius',
till we oome to the short aooount of tha dootrine of the
De Interpretatione and the Prior Anelyties, written in
the seoond oentury hy Apuleius. This ooours in the
third hook of his treetise De Dogmote Platonis ,· and the
singular error of attributing the syllogistio theory to
Plato has oaused the genuineness of this hook to be
questioned ⁸. The only other logioal writings iu Latin
before Boethius, are the two worlrs attributed to St
Angustine; the one, an shridgtnent of the Cetegories,
now generally allowed to be spurious, but probably
written about the same period; the other, an uofinished
tendes sailed Principio Dialectioo, the oernrnenoetneut
of an essay ou langnage with a view to disputation.
To these must he added the singular allegory of Mar-
oianus Capella, on the Meninge of Meroury and Philo-
logy ς a medley of prose and verse, eornposed probably
towards the end of the fifth oentnry. The Seven Liberel
Arts, afterwards so oelebrated as forming the Triviuut
and Quadrivlunr, or Enoyolopeedia of the middle ages,
appear in the following order, Grammar, Dialeotio,
Rhetorio, Geometry‚ Arithmetio, Astronorny, and Musiol.
Dialeotio is represented as a female of a sour oounte·

¹¹ M. St Hilaire has oommittsd an evernight in eiting the division of
the seven liberal arte from the Dialeotio of Augustino. No sueh division
ooeurs there; though one nearly the same is found in his second Book
De ordina eb. le. M. Hanrean (de la Philosopbie Soholastique, vol. i.
p. 21.) attributes the invention of this olaesifloatiou to Capella. vhioh ie
hardly reoonoileable with the above reference.
