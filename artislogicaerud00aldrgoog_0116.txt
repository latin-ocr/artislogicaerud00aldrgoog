served, that the old Logicians, following Boethius, main·
tain, that in conversion by composition, ae well as in
the others, the quality should romain unchenged. Gon·
sequently the converse of ‘⁶ All A is B¹’ is “All not B ie
not A,”,snd of “Some A is not Β,” “Some not B is not
not A.” It is simpler, however, to convert A into E andO
into 1, (“ No notBisA;” ‘¹ Some notBis A‚”) as is done by
Wallis and Abp. Whately; sud before Boethius by Apuleius
and Capella, who notice the conversion, but do not give it a
name. The principle of this conversion may be found in
Aristotle, Top. ii. 8. 1. though he does not employ it for
logical purposes.
⁰ Sit vere Ε. This is the proof given by Theophrastus
and Eudemus. (Alexander, Scholia, p. 148. b. 29.) Aristotle
proves it hythe method called ἔκθεσις, i. e. by the exhibitiva
of an individual instance, (ἐκτιθέναι exponere seusui; whencee
syllogism with singular premises is called syllogismus ocyo-
siteeius.) Thus, No A is B, therefore No B is A, for if not,
Some iudieiduel B, say O, is A. Then G is both A and B,
and therefore it will not be true thatNo A is B; which was
the original proposition. Aristotle does not assume the eon-
version of I to prove that of E, which would be arguing in a
circle. For e fuller account, see Hamilton on Reid, p. 696.
Alexander himself offers a third proof by syllogism in the
first figure. No A is B, therefore No B is A; for suppose
“SomeBisA,”and“NoAisB,”.· SomeBisnotB.
Having proved the conversion of E, those of A and I will
follow from it. “All A is B, therefore Some B is A;'‘ or else
No B is A, and therefore (by conversion) No A is B; whereas
we assumed All Ais B. And again, Some A is B, therefore
SomeBisA; or else NoBis A, aud therefore NoAis B.
For these proofS, the only assumption necessary is the
principle of contradiction.. But proof of any kind is super·
fluous. Conversion and other immediate inferences are
necessary results of the laws of thought, equally evident
