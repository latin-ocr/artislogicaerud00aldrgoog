analogous to that of drawing formal inferences‚ chtualby
contained in their premises, though not explicitly de·
veloped0. Itis a process ol seli-examination, not dis-
similar ιο the Platonic application cf Dialectic, though
widely differing as regards the objective truth cf its
results. uer the Logical process furnishes cnlya suh·
jective criterion3 it enables us to represent more dis·
tinctly to the mind, the notione previously existing there
in more cr less ccnlirsicnr its rules directus ιο compare
concepte one with another, and fumish some security
fc'r our own consistency in employing them3 they dc
not enable us ιο ascertain their accordance with external
objecta or ιο add the deficient parts, where they are
inadequate representatives of the latter. ‘The mind, like
the shy, has its nebulae, which the telescope oi Logic
may resolve into their component stars. But here the
parallel censes. The Logicel instrument discovers no
luminary whose rays have not previously entered the
eye; it tells us nothing oi their relative distances, ci
the velooity with which their light travels3 cf any thing,
in short, which did not form a confused portion of the
sensuous representation Ψ. This may seem but beggarly
service ιο be performed by the Art cf Arte end Science
cf Sciences. inferior certainly it is to the gigantic pur-
poses which more than one Logical Titan has essayed
tc aooomplish with the same instrument. But let not its
legitimate uses be contemned, because it has abated
somewhat cf the “ vaulting ambition which c’erleaps
itself.” It furnishes the mculd hy which the ever·
accumulaling matter of conscicusness is reduced ιο fcnn
and consistencyr it were ungrateful tc despice it, because
it dces not also dig the metel itself from the mine.
