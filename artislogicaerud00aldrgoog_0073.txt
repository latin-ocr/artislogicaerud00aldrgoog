i.4,12.) The συνώνυμα of Aristotle must be distinguished
from the modern synonyme, which cnswer to the πολυώνυμα of
Speusippus (Schol. p. 43, o. 31.) ond the multivoca of Boethius,
end ere defined by the letter, “ quorum pluro nomine, une
· definitio est.” Συνώνυμα wos used in this sense by the Stoice,
end the same sense moy also be found in Aristode, Rhet. iii.
2. 7. end perhaps Top. viii. 13. 2.

¹ It is not cocyto distinguish eccurctely the two divisione
ol terme into absolute and connotative, abstraerent con-
crete, respectively. The following attempt is mede with some
doubt es to its success. In the second chapter of the
Cetegories, Aristotle divides ull dna into four classes, Uni·
versel Substances singular substances‚ Universel Attributes‚
and Singular Attributes. Substences ol both kinds exist per
rc; attributes can only exist in substances. Honos the
scholastic distinction between Subjects of Prodicetion and
Subjects ol Inhesion. The universal substances are pre-
diceble ottho singular, es genere nrid species of individuals.
⁴‘ Socrates is o man.¹’ In this cose the individuel is a subject
of predication. Attributes ere not in their original state
predicoble of substantes. Whiteness exists in snow; but we
cannot say, “Snow is whiteness.’' Here, then, the subject is
not one of predication‚ but of inhesion. But, by en act of the
mind, on attribute moy be so connected with e subject es to
become prediceble of itas adifferentie, property, or accident ;
e. g. “ snow is white.’' Predicates thus formed from attributes
ere called connotatioc, being said to signify pomonly the
attribute, and to connotc or nynisy recondarily the subject of
inhesion. Hence e connotative term may be defined, “One
which primarily significo en attribute, seconderily n subject”
