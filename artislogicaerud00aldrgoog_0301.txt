‘⁸ Magnitudeo equol to the adjacent extonior and ‘interior
angles of a triangle are equal to each otheri

The three interior angles and two right angles are equal ιο
the adjacent exterior and interior angles3

Thereiore, they are equal to each other.¹'

The major premise of this Syllogism is an immediate
deduction from tho first axiom3 thus:

‘⁴ Magnitudea which are equal to the same eae equal to
each other;

Magnitudes equal to the acijacent exterior and interior
angles are equal ιο the same3 ’

Theresore‚ they are equel ιο each other¹.-''

Thai the true syllogistic analyaisof Geometrioal Demon-
strations will always be in this. somthe axioma standing
aa major promises, and the constructione in each case
fumishing the :proper minor, is evident. It only remains

ιο see whether the text-of Aristode oen he accommodated
to this interpretation as well as to the other.

With some passages it evidently talliea much better.
The places in which the axioma are mentioned in
connexion avith demonstration have never 'been eatis-
factorily explained on ¹the scholastio interpretation ¹²¹(

³ The difficulty is evaded rather than surmounted hy distinguishing
immediate propositione from axioms, and saying that thalatter are employed

axioma immediate principles of syllogism‚ and principles from which we
demonstrate. *In the second place,any principle which virtually anthia and
confirma the premises of a demonstration must, if the syllogistic theory be
worth any thing, he capable of syllogistic connexion with the premises which

it confirms: and until this connexion is formally ,exhibitam no demon-
stration can he logically complete.
