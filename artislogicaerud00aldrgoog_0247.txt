The first of these is his method of investigating, or,
es he terms it, huntiny for, the Definition. This may be
effected in two ways, commonly called the methods of
Division and Induction. The first of these consists in
taking a wide Genus under which the object to be defined
is evidently included, and contrecting it by the addition
of successive differentiae, till we obtain n complex notion
coextensive with that of which the Definition is sought
Of the notion thus obtained, ecch seperate part is more
extensive then thet which is to be defined, though the
whole is not sot A good example of this method is
given by Cicero, Topica, c. 6. “Sic igitur veteres praeci-
piunt: cum sumseris ea, quae sint ei rei, quam definire
velis, cnm aliis communia, usque eo persequi, dum pro-
prium efficiatur, quod nullam in aliam rem transferri
possit. Ut hoc, Hereditas est pecunia· Commune
adhuc: multe enirn genera sunt pecuniae. Adde quod
sequitur: quae morte alicujus ad quempiam pervenit
Nondum est definitio: multis enirn modis sine hereditate
teneri mortuorum pecuniae possunt. Unum adde verbum,
jure: jam e communitate res disjuncta videbitur, nt sit
explicato definitio sic: Hereditas est pecunia, qnae
morte alicujus ad quempiam pervenit jure. Nondum
est satis: adde, nec ea aut legata testamento, eut pos·
sessione retenta: confectum est.’'

t Anal. Post. ii. 13. 3. Τὰ δὴ τοιαῦτα ληπτέον μέχρι wiron, ἕως τοσαῦτα
,ληφθῇ πρῶτον, ὧν ἕκαστον μὲν ἐπὶ πλεῖον ὑπάρξει, ἅπαντα δὲ μὴ ἐπὶ πλέον·
ταύτην γὰρ ἀνάγκη οὐσίαν εἶναι τοῦ irpdyparos. Yet in the Metephysics
(vi. 12.) he seems to maintain that the last differentis must be coex-
tensive with the subject3 e view generally adopted by the Scholasne
Logiciens, though manifestly inconsistent, not only with the passage chors
quoted, hut with the example appended, rh δὲ τελευταῖον καὶ τῇ δυάδι. In
the Metophysics however he seems to he speaking, not of the specifio
difference per se, but of the difference regarded es dividing the genus.

But this is in sect equivalent only to seying thet the whole must he co· ·
extensivs; which no one would think ot denying.
