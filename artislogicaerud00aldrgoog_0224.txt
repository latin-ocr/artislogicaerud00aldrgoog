case are straight lines, in the other, arcs of great circlesn.
But when one only of the compared notions is employed
as the subject of a proposition, and a portion of the
attributes which it comprehendo is predicated of it, that
predicate cannot properly be called Genus or Differentia,
the comparison from which these distinctions arise having
eeased.

With this proviso, we may adopt, mutatis mutandis, ,

the classification of the Predicables given by Aristotla
himself, as fumishing a more satisfactory groundwork
than either the. Isagoge of Porphyry or its subsequent
scholastic embellishments. Every Proposition‚ accord·
ing to Aristotle, expresses one of four relations of the
Predicate to its Subject3 Genus, (under which may be
included Differentia,) Definition, Property, or Accident0.
For every Predicate must either be convertible with its
subjector not. If convertible, it either expresses the
whole Essenos (τὸ rl ἦν εἶναι) of the Subjeot or not. In
the former case it is called Definition, in the latter,
Property. If not convertible, it either expresses part of
the Essenos or not. In the former case it is Genus, in
the latter, Aecident.

’ This division, being founded on dichotomy by contra·
diction, must necessarily exhaust every possible mode of
Predication. Interpreting tha Essenos, in accordante
with our present view, as the sum of the attributes
comprehended ina notion, we shall find all four mem·
bers admissible where the Subject of the proposition

⁰ See Topica, i. 8. Sundry attempta have been made, not very suceess-
fully, to reconcile this account with that of Porphyry. But though some
lioense of interpretation may bc allowed, when the object is tc reconcile
an author with himself, it is scarcely necessary to strain his language into
agreement with awriter who lived more than six centurias after him, and
who does not eren profess to be commenting on him.
