Ineptum est hoc Sophisma. l. Quia solvitur
ambulando; quod fecit Diogenes ¹. 2. Quoniam
ex ipsa Hypothesi, Dum Testudo quae praecessit
spatio A, conficit ,30 A, Achilles conficiet 2 A;

that the fallacy does not lie in the form, but in the matter.
Thus, representing the whole space 10 be traversed by a.

“Any space equal Tio· 1- rio 1- l—Jffi dcc. is infinite, (being
the sum 01 an infinite series.) The space 10 be passed before
Achilles overtakes the tortoise is equal to this sum. There
fore it is infinite.”

The whole logical mystery 01 this famous fallacy lies in
this, that tbe major prembe 10 false. The sum 01 au infinite
series may be, and in this case ie, finite! This premise is
equally false, whether space is or is not divisible ad infinitum.

the sophism, see Hegel‚ Werke, vol. iii. p. 218. Fries‚ Syrtem

solution attempted by Goleridge. (10110001, vol. iii. p. 93.) is

, It may be observed, that Aldrioh is mistaken as regards

Zeno's object in this Sophiam. Ι1 was proposed 10 support
the leading tenet 01 Parmenides of the unity of all things, by

shewing that the identity 01 rest and motion is a necessary
result from the contrary opinion. Ι1 does not appear, however,
that Zeno advanced this argument seriously. His principal
design was 10 retort the ridicule which had been thrown on
the doctrine 01 Parmenides, by involving his opponente in
the same absurdities which they professed 10 find in his
theory. of. Plato, Parm. p. 128. Arist. Scpb. Elcncb. 10. 2.

· r The solution 01 Diogenes proves nothing. Zeno contende
that reason contradicts the evidence 01 the senses. Diogenes
replies that the evidence of the sensas contradicts that 01
reason. Who denied that?
