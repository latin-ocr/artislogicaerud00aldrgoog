history of an individual. The adoption of this type has
led ιο the logical anomaly, that the propositions of a
hypothetica] syllogism are generally stated without any
designate quantity; whereas it is obvious that, wherever
concepta are compared together in any form of reasoning,
two distinct conclusione may follow, according to the
quantity assigned. F or example, to the promise, “ Ii men
are wise, they will consult their permanent interests,”
we may supply two minore and conclusione, in the con·
structive form, according as we affirm the antecedent of
alt men or of rome. lt thus becomes necessary ιο dis·
tinguish between two different kinds oi apparent hypo·
thetical syllogismo, those in which the interanea is from
a general hypothesis to all or some of its special
instances, and those in which a relation between two
individual facts is assumed as a hypothesis leading to
a singular conclusion. The former contain a general
relation of determining and determined notion, which
may always ba expressed in three terms 3 the occasional
employment of four being only an accidental variety of
language. Thus the general assertion, “ If any country
is justly governed, the people are happy,'’ is equivalent
tc, “ If any country is justly governed, it has happy
people.” This we may apply to special instances3 cll
coactriea, recte coactries, or thie country, being asserted
to be justly governed: and this is properly hypotheticol
, rearoaicp. The latter denote only a material connection
between two single facts, either of which may, to certain
minds possessed of certain additional knowledge, bc an
indication of the other3 but the true ground of the
inference is contained in this additional knowledge, and
not in the mere hypothetical coupling ol' the facts by
a conjunction. This is not hypothetical reasoning;
i. e. it is not reasoning from the hypothesis, but from
