ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEMONSTRATIVE SYLLOGISM.

Scrnurrrrc knowledge (τὸ ἐπίστασθαι), except when of
axiomatic principles⁸, requires a conviction of the neces·
sity of the proposition known, and a knowledge cf its
causel. This is produced by the Demonstrative or
Scientific Syllogism, which, according to Aristotle’s¹
definition, is ἐξ ἀληθῶν καὶ πρώτων καὶ ἀμέσων καὶ γνωριμω-

τέρων καὶ προτέρων καὶ αἰτίων τοῦ συμπεράσματοςθ. As the

conclusions of this Syllogism are necessary, so must
also be the premises3 this necessity consists in their
being per re, in either the first cr the second sense of
that expressionl. If any of these conditions are not
oomplied with; e. g. if the premise, though containing

⁸ In the strict sense of the terma, detornatae is said of necessary truths
which we receive by deductiori from higher truths3 νοεῖν, of those which we
receive as evident of themselves Hence the principe] meaning of the
corresponding terma, ἐπιστήμη and νοῦς. The latter, however, or rather its
result, is sometimes called ἐπιστήμη ἀναπόδεικτος. Cf. Anal. Posti 3. 2, 3.
i. 33. l. ii. 19. 7. Eth. Nic. vi. 9. 9. The word {iponinthe first and last of
these places, does not mean, as Pacius explains, simple terma, but, as
M. St. Hilaire rendere, “les propositions immediatos,” i. e. axioma-the
limite from which Demonstration commences.

thing; i. e. not demonstrable by a middle term from any higher truth;
γνωριμώτερα sc. φύσει, not ἡμῖν, i. e. more universal.

ἃ Of necessity. three degrees ere enumerated, Anel. Post i. 4. Κατὰ
παντός, καθ αὑτό, and ᾗ αὐτό; usually rendered, de ornet, per se, and
quatenus tpstrm. Of per se, as applied tc a proposition, four scnses arc
given. 1. When the predicate is part of the definition of the subject.
2. When the subject is partos the definition of the predicate. 3. When
existence is predicated of e substance. 4. When the subjectis the external
efficient cause of the predicate. Propositions in Demonstration proper
must be per re either in the first or second meaning. See Auel. Post. i.
