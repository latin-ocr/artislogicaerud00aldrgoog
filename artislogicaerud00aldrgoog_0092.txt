viduam, ita et Communis ⁸ Dividaa dici potest.
Eam enim per Metaphoram dividere dicitur, qui
plura ejus significata recenset; nam in uno multa
distinguit. lta qui animal dicit care (i. e. voca-
bulum animal significare) hominem et brutam,
dicitur animal inhominem brutamque dividere.
Quare Divisiol, est distincta enumeratio plurium,

¹¹ Division was employed by Plato and others as a method
oi demonstrating definitione. Aristotle shows that the rea-
soning is unsound, and always involves apetitio principii. For
this reason he calls it a kind ol weak syllogism, though he
allows it to be usesul for testing definitione when gained: see
Appendix, note Ο. Among the later Peripatetico, Division
seems to have been held in higher estimation; a separate
heatise on the subject having been composed by Andronicus
Rhodius. From them it descended to BoethiuS, whose book
dc Diuisione is the principal authority from which subsequent
logicians have drawn.

AccordingtoBoethiuS,thawordDivision is uscdinthreeprin-
cipal sensas. l. Division oi aganus into species. 2. Division
oi a whole into parts. 3. Division oi an equivocal term into
its several significatione. Of these, according to Cicero, Top.
ch. 6. the first is properly called Divisio, the second, Partitio.
“In partitione quasimembra sunt; ut corporiS, caput, humeri,
manus, latera, crura, pedae, et cetera: in divisione, formae sunt.
quas Graeci ideas vocant ; nostri, si quihaeciorte tractant, species
appellant.” cf. Quintil. v. 10. vii. 1. In Division, the whole
cr its definition can be predicated of each part, as “Homo est
animal‚” “Homo est vivens sensibile.’' In Partition this can-
not be done. Boethius, however, includes under his second
head, not only the enumeration oi the componant parts of an
individual, but also that of the individuale contained under an
infima spectac. “Ut cum dico domus aliud esse tectum, aliud
paries, aliud fundamentum cumque hominia dicimus partes
csse (latonam, Virgilium, Ciceronem.” The last in ona respect
