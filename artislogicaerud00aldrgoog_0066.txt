the toooodqe of things was regarded by this school as only
the remote object of the Loyico uteru, as applied to >this or
that matter, and hence not to¹ be gained from any logical
trectise. Thus the distinction insisted upon by some critias
between in cognitione and in cognitionem, is of no value; both
being merely verbal variations in expressing the same view.
This definition of Logic as an art arose from the dialec-
tical and rhetorical innovatione introduced by the reformers
of Logia in the latter part of the fifteenth century, and was
adopted universally by Ramus and his followers, as well as
by the Peripatetico-Ramista of the school of Keokermann‚
and afterwards by the Cartesians Among the earlier philo-
sopham, the Peripatetico considered Legio to be neither art
nor orienes, butan instrument. The Stolos regarded it as a
scienoe, in which they were followed by the Schoolmen.
Subsequently, in the sohools of Wolf and Kant, Logic again
obtained the name of Scienca though the former regarded it
as a practioal, the latter, more correotly‚ as a speculative
sciense. Cf. Zabarella de Natura Lepino, lib. i. Smigleoii
