banishiug to a separate region, under tho nurna of
Applied Legio, the psychologieal precepta which his
predecessore, especially the Certosiuns, had incorporated
with the body of tho scicnco, and giving thereby to
formal thought its proper position as tlrc object el Pure
Logic. llis ‹lernonstration that an universal material
criterion oi truth is not only impossible, but seli-con·
tradictory¹, has furnished us with the principle of a
more liberal and enlightened appreciation ol the real
character and salue of formal thinking than ean be
supplied by the whole previous history of philosophy.

At the same time, it must be admitted that the logical
system of Kant is chargeable with one serious deficiency‚
which has hoen prominently shown in the subsequent
history of the scicnec. lle ‹livorces altogether his ὰ
priori science froin all connection with the psycho-
logical phenomena of conscionsness, from all examination
of the actual characteristica of any determinate operation
of thought‘. These matters hc rejects as empirical3 but
without such empiricisrn, Legio and all pure soienee is
impossible. lt is matter of each man's personal experi-
ence thathe actually thinks 3 and, without examination of
the phenomena oi special ectsof thought, it is impossible
to ascertain the necessary lawe oi thought in genstall.
Legio and Psychology thus necessarily form portione
of one and the same philosophieal course, and, without
a knowledge of the latter, it is impossible to have any
sounrl criticism or accurate estimato of the former.
