expresaed3 but it seems prohablc that he regarded the
formal conse only as availahle for the purposes of De·
finition. For a material cause, properly speaking, has
no place in attributes, but only in physical substancesl3
and that which in the former is most nearly analogous
to matter, viz. the necessary condition out of which the
effect ariseS, may in such cases be identified nith the
formal cause. This Aristotle allous in the chapter in
question, when he states that the material cause there
instanced as a middle term is in fact the same as the
formala. The efficiant and final causes seem to be
excluded, as not being contemporaneous with their
effecta, so that from the existence of the one we cannot
certainly inser that of the other ¹¹. Whereas the formal
cause is expressly distinguished as τὸ rl ἦν εἶναιῆ and
the examples given of it iu Anal. Post. ii. 12. l. corre-
spoud exactly to those previously given as Definitions
The other causes only accidentally serre the same pur-
pose, in those instances in which they coincide with the
formala

Avery differant view has been tahan by some Logicians. Orokanthorpe,
for example, maintains that Demonstration can only he, “a cansa efficiente
per emanationem, val a causa efficiente per externam actionem, vela causa
finali;” and he devotas a chapter to shewing that neither the Material
nor the Formal cause ean be a middle term iu Demonstration, though
the efficient cause ol the Attribnte may be the sorrnal eausa of the
