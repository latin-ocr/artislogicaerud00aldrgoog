Species at Homo, has an obvious and sufficient answer.
Ι did not make the world, he might say; Substances,
universal as well as singular, exist independently of y
me; Istate facts as I find them, and arn not bound to
determine why they are so. But let a Conceptualist or
Nominalist¹ talk of a Lowest Species, and he is refuted at
once by his own fundamental doctrine. The several
Species are our own mention, as abstract ideas, or as
significatione of words. You have no right arbitrarily
to declara that you will form complex conceptione thus
low and no lower3 or, at least, if you fix such limite sor
your own convenience, you have no right to impose the
same restrictiori on othere.

The same remarks apply to the theory of an absolute
differentia, such as rationale, predicable of all men and
of none but men, and sarving to distinguish that species,
not from some other given species, but from all others
whatever. Porphyry, as has been before observed, ad-

¹Between Nominalirm and Conceptualism there is no real difference,
unless in conjunction with the latter we maintain the power of the mind
to form Universal notione, unaided by verbal or other symbols. And even
then, all Nominslism will be Conceptualism, though all Conceptualism
will not be Nominalism. For Universals ean only be identified with names
by considering these as the signs of notione. Yet Nominalism hasbeen
accused ae destructive oi cll Philosophy, and that by the advocates oi
Conceptualisra. But the fundamental error of Hobbes and his followers
is not their doctrine of Univereal Termi, but their theory oi the impert oi
Proposttr'ons. The two, however, are not necessarily connected. We may
. adopt Loelre’s theory of abstraot ideas, without maintaining with him that
knowledge is the perception of the agreement or disagreement ol two
ideam and we may hold that general notione require the aid of language,
without maintaining with Hobbes, that truth and falsshood depend on
names, or with condiliac, that science is only slanguege well constructad.
But, not to argue this point here, we may observe, that the Scholastio
Nominalists, st least Abelard and Occam, were Conceptualists. With
regard te Roscelin, itis hardly fair, upon the slight notices we possess oi
his views, to identify his Nominslism with that of Hobbes, whom Leibnitz

rightly cosse, plusquam Nantuatis. No one can suppose Abelard's deductio
od abritrium to be a fair statement oi Rosoelin's views.
