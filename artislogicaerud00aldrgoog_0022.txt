Aristotle enumeratas four different kinds of reasoning,
to which the colloquial form (τὸ διαλέγεσθαι) was applied,
λόγοι transnatat, διαλεκτικοί, πειραστικοί, and lgrortaol a. The
first are demonstrative reasonings, from the proper and
axiomatic principles of a given subject. The second, or
dialectic reasonings in the Aristotelian sense of the term,
arc those derived from general principles of probability,
such as the opinions of the majority of mankind, or of
philosophers. The third are only a special application
of probable reasonings to exposa the ignorance of pre-
tenders in science¹. The fourth are fallacious reasonings,
from apparent but not real probabilities. In a sub·
sequent passage, he distinguishes between ἐριστικοί and
coccorano& the former being such as employ fallacy
merely for a display of skill; the latter, for pecuniary
profit. Hence he defines σοφιστική as χρηματιστικῆ τις ἀπὸ
σοφίας φαινομένην. These distinctions however will be of
comparatively late origin3 after the various applicatione
of the original methodos Zeno had rendered specific
names necessary.

Tho eristic or sophistic was, as might naturally be
expected, the earliest of these special developments of
the dialectis method. The arguments of Zeno himself
had no small affinity to sophistry3 and the state of
philosophy at that period was such as naturally to
promote further advance in the same directicn. The
conflicting opinions of the three great pre-Socratic
schools‚ the Ionian, the Pythagorean, and the Eleatic;
the one-sided and exclusive character of their principles,

unjust to the ancient dialectic, when he describes itas a sophistica] art of
giving illusion the appearance of truth. The tentative use of dialectic very

nearly corresponded with his own.
