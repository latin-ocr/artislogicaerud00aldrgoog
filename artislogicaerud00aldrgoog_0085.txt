the potential extension and comprehension araboth within
the province ol Logic5 and as regards things, the real essencc
ol a species and the actual subdivisions of aganus araboth
equally without. The distinction itselfis of great importanoe,
and hasbeen expressed in various ways, hy the terme potentini
and actual whole, whole in predication and in dejicition, ani·
ensal and assentiet whole, dcc. The best is that adopted hy
the PortRoyal LogicianS, who distinguish the eetmsion or
subjecte of which a notion is predicable from the comprehm«
aion or attributes which it involves in itself. Thus genus is
a whole in extensior species a whole in comprehension. On
this important distinction, see the Introduction to Mr.
Baynee's Translation of the PortRoyal Logic, p. xxxii. or
Mr. Thomson's Outline of the Laws of Thought‚ p. 128.

2The dammam Genus and the infima Species, as here
described, are both merely imaginary limite, never arrived at
in any process of actual thought. The notion of Baiae or
even of substance in general, apert from this or that special
combination of attributae, and that of a combination so
complex as to admit os no additional attributes in thought,
are both psychologically inconceivable. A Highest Genus
and a Lowest Species may he admitted in any material
science, as the limits at which the investigatione of that
scienoe begin and end ; but euch a limitationis made entirely
on material grounds, relatively to the purposes of that par·
ticnlar science, and cannot be recognised by Logic. See
Appendix, note A.
