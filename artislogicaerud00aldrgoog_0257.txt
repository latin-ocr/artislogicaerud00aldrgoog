Aristode, one isin form not distinguishable from the
legitimate Syllogism ⁸. Seleoting this variety, 88 thet by
which most 81811 118 objectionis to be sustained, we
will proceed 18 examine its peculiarities.

18 the first place, it is manifestly necessary to 8
Potitio 1188881111, 88 118 fallaoy may more correctly be
called, that there should be a question proposed for
precs. And hence it was long ego acutely remarked by
Petrus Hispanus, that such afallacy cannot 18 8818-
mitted in a Syllogism 81 aserenam. If, that is, the·
truth 81 the premises is known beforehand‚ and the only
question is, what may we 18181 from them? there is no
necessity 181 1899189 81 assumption 81 any kind. It is
clear then, that not the Syllogism 18 general, but 81
most only 888 particular application 81 11, 888 beg the
question.

But it may bc answered‚ that the truth 81 such premises '

never can be ascertained, but by a previous induction
embracing all particular 88888, aud that Syllogistic in-
ferenoe is therefore at least 181118, 81888 118 conclusion
drawn must 18 presumed to be already known. But
this answer itself assumes what has never yet 1888
satisfactorily proved, the dependence 81811 knowledge
81 Universals 88 Induction. 11 axiomatic principles can
be acquired in any other way, one class 81 Syllogisms is
81 least exempt from the charge ¹.
