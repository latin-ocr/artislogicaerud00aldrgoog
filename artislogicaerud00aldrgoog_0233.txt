of objecto, but from tbe analysis of assertione. This is
manifest from the name and from the manner of treat-
ment. Karnyogla, κατηγορεῖν, κατηγόρημα, κατηγορούμενον,
κατηγοςνκός, have all primarily reference to forms of
speech3 the term κατηγορία being used by Aristotle as
well for any predicate term, as for the highest gene·
ralizations under which predicates can be classed‘. ln
the beginning of the treatise on the Categories, terms as
combined in a proposition are made to precede terms
regarded separately⁸; and the propositiones the only
assertion capable of truth and falsehood, appears to be
regarded as the unitos speech, of which the simple term
is but a fractional clement ¹¹.

It is therefore probable, that the Aristotelian distinction
of Gategories arose from the resolution of the proposition
and a classification of the grammatioal distinctions indi-
cated by its parts. The noun substantive leads usto the
category of etsta, the adjectivcs of number and of quality
to ποσόν and ποιόν, the adjective of comparison to πρός τι,
the adrerbs of place and time to verland ποτέ, the different
forms of the verb, intransitive, praeterite, active, and pas-
sive, to κεῖσθαι, ἔχειν, ποιεῖν, aud πάσχειν ³. It is true thatin
his subsequent treatment the philosopher by no means
adheres strictly to the grammatical point of view, and
that his classification may, even on his own principles,
be considerably simplified3 but it must be remembered,
that at that time the science of Grammar was in its
infancy‚ that its forms of speech had not been analysed
completely, nor its boundaries clearly separated from
those of Logic and Metaphysics.
