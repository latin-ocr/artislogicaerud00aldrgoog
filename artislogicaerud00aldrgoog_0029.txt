lt was dirided into two parts, Dialectic and Rhetoric, to
which some added a third, the ὄςικόν or doctrine of
Definition‚ employed asa critericn of truth·. Their
Dialectic, which also contained a considerable mixture
of Grammar, was defined es the soience cf rightly con-

continuone speech. It is criticised by Cicero, es prolix

Action. Cicero appears to have entertained no very
high opinion of it¹t Butos the details of the Stoioal

for the investigation ofphysical truth¹. Adeteiled account
of these is given by Gassendi, De Oripinc Loqicae, c. 7.

To the Philosophers succeeded the Commentators·
These contributed but little new material to logical
sciense, but did a good deal for the explanation and
illustration cf the text of Aristode, and assisted in some
degree in fixing the language of the science⁸. The
Greek Commentators on the Organon ere principally
