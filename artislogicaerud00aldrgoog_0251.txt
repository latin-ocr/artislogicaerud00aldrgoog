ΙΙ. Logic bas nothing to do with testing the material
concernentes a definition, i. e. ascertaining how far the
notions developed in our analysis cf a given concept
correspond to the principal phenomena exhibited by the
objecta usually included under that concept; nor even
with the inquiry‚ whether our usage of terms corresponds
with the ordinary langnage of others.

ΙΙΙ. Stil] less does it lie within the province of Logic
to perform the functions either of a Dictionary or of an
Index to Physical Science; to convey, thetis, information
from without, whether conceming the meaning of words
or the nature of things, into a mind previously ignorant. “
Whereas from the statements of some Logicians, one
might almost imagine that they regarded their Science
as fumishing, as it were, Logarithmio Tables of things in

we have only to refer any given object, to obtain full

ceditur definitis per singula praedicamenta.¹'
