to which they bclong‘.

This passage is generally found puzzling to a beginner
on two accounts. Firstly, he is apt to fancy Dialectic
synonymous with Logic, and to confonnd it with the
formal Scienoe of that name; an error which the Gom·
mentary most likely to fall in his way is not unlikely
to confirm. Secondly‚ having previously seen the Enthy-
meme defined as the Rhetorica] Syllogism3 there seems
some inconsisteney in the subsequent observatiou, that
some Enthymemes are Rhetorieal, others not so.

ln explanation it may be observed. Firstly, that
Dialectic and Rhetoric are not formal Sciences, but
material Arta. Their Logic is not a Loyicc docear,
treating of the general form of Reasoning, but a Loyica
ι utem, treating of Reasoning as applied to a particular
matter. That matter is furnished by the τόποι. Rhetoric
and Dialectic do not merely lay down the form in which
their reasonings ought to proceedbut likewise provide
certain general principles cf probability, from which the
matter of their major premises is to be drawn. These
τόποι or common-places hold the same position in the ¹
Dialectic Syllogism, as the most universal kind of
axioms iu the Demonstrative. They are not gained by
exclusive observation of any one particular class of
objecta belonging to this or that art cr faculty, but are
indifferently applicable to all. Such is the example
quoted by Aristotle as ὁ τοῦ μᾶλλον καὶ ἧττον τόπος. Of
this in the Topics be gives four casea, cf which the
following may be taken as a specimen. “If the more
likely assertion on any subject be untrue, the less likely
is probably untrue likewise.'‘ A general maxim of this
