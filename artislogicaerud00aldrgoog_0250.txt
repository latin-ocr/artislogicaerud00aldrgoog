Organon of Aristotle is desigued as a systematis treatise
on a single subject called Logia, such testimony must ba

already treated of in the Introduction, and need not be
repeated here. Itis sufficient to say that, as far as any
evidence is furnished, either by the writings of Aristotle

an inquiry into the material truth of the propositions in

it must be remembered‚ that no attribute can be syllogis-

promise asserted of another; and it is upon the material
truth of the latter proposition that the certainty of the
