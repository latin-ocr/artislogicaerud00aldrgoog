L1.1.

Method in either sense is not properly a part os Pure or
Formal Logic. It is an application oi Logic ιο the discovery
or communication of truths in material science: its rules
cannot be determined ὰ priori from the laws of thought; but
must be gathered empirically from the examination ol parti-
cular sciences, and will require modification in many instances
from the particular matter with which they have ιο deal.

⁶ The Malaca Inamtionis can only be aprocess of inference:
for no anonymam os parts is possible before they have been
discovered. The discovery of general principles from individual
objecta of sense, if limited to the inferential process itself,
will be Ivrduction. The term, however, is sometimes extended
so as to include the preliminary accumulation of individuals.
In this wider sense it will embrace the four successive steps
given by Aristotle, Anul. Post ii. 19. αἴσθησις, μνῆμη, ἐμπειρία,

Βοι the Methodus inventiones must not be absolutely limited
to Induction and its preliminaries‚ though these are the most
important instrumenta of discovery. In some sciences, as in
mathematica truths are chiefly discovered by demonstration;
and till so discovered, cannot, os course, be imparted to others
by the nwtlcodua doctrina.

Induction and Syllogism are the only two methods oi
infcrcnce. The Greek commentators, Ammonius and Eu·
strabus», enumerate four, adding Division and Definition; but
in these last there is no reasoning process. See Zabarella,
de Methodis‚ lib. iii. cap. 5 sqq. If we extend the method ol
discovery beyond the process os inierence proper, so as to
include any accumulation os knowledge, we may distinguish
three principal instrumenta. 1. Pure experienca, applicable to
