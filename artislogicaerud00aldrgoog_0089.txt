⁸ The term specific dr‘jfcrcncc (διαφορὰ alterode) has a different
meaning in Porphyry. It is opposed to occidental diffcrcncc
(διαφορὰ κατὰ συμβεβηκός) and marks the differentia proper,
which distinguishes species from species (whether subaltern
or infima) as opposed to accidents, which only distinguish
between individuals.

‘Proprium In formal logio, which cannot take into
account the realist theory of essences, it becomes necessary
to change slightly the language which expresses tha dis·
tinction between proprium and differentia. The essence cf a
concept is the sum of the attributes which it comprehende
Whatever does not form a part of the comprehensiva of the
concept or of the sipnlflccticn of its name, is not port os but
joined to the essence: i. e. it is found in all or some of the
individuals of the class, but is not implied in the name or
notion of the class itself. Thus it is no part of the notion of
a triangle that its angles are equa] to two right angles; and it
is no part of the notion of a body to have weight. These then

distinction of property from accident, as necessarily or con·
