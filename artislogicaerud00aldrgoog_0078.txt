ᾗ. 4. Vox Singularis, dicitur alio nomine Iudi-
uiduum, ejusque significatum Uuum uuuruo .· neque
eninr singulare est quicquid Unum dici potest; sed
multa, quae sunt invicem similia, eatenus Unum
censentur. Vocantur enim uuo eodemque nomine3
quod ipsa Vocis definitio¹¹ non patitur, nisi in illis

combination to fix it on the rost. In this sense Geometrical
Magnitudes are called by Aristotle τὰ ἐξ ἀφαιρέσεως, (Aa. Post.
1. 18. 1.); because the Geometer considers only the properties
of the yiyurr, separating them from those of the material in
which it is found. (See Au. Post. I. bb Meropo. x. 3. 7.)
On similar grounds is formed the scholastic distinction of
obstruet and coaucta terms; since in the former the attribute
is considered apart from the subject in which it is perceived
by the senses: e. g. sight presente to us' only uibu- the mind
forms the conception albedo. And so Universals are gained
by obstructiora, i. e. by separating the phenomena in which a
