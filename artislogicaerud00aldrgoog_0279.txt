ln thie point of view, Division end Definitiou are respee'·
tively the Synthesis and Anslysiv of notione aa expremd
in simple terme. ln the former, we combine¹ Genus and
Differentia into Speoies; iu tbe latter, we resolve Species
into Genus end Differentie. A similar relation existe
between tbe prooesses of uniting Aoeidents to e Species,
in distinguisbing its several individuale, and abstraoting
the Speeifio notion from the decidente, in the formation
oi Universels. Syllogism end Induotion in like manner
are respectively the Synthesis and Anelysis vof the same
notione when formiup tlte subjecte rs a jedpment. For
on examination of the first figure, whioh is the natural
form of Syllogism‚ it will be seen, that it prooeeda by
diehien of the middle terrn, to predioete of the several
Species what was previously predioeted of the Genus.
Inductiou, on the other hand, in its natural form, pro·
eeeds by e process of abstractim, from the individuale
eonstituting a Species to their eommon Speeies so eonsti-
tuted. r
As regards the etymology of the neme; both the
Greek ἓπαγωγῆ, and its Latin equivalent Inductio, seem
to heve been originally applied with referenoe to the
Souratio accumulatiora of instanoes to serve as an antess
cedent for establishing the required oonolnsion. The
Platonie use of ἐπάγειν will support this viewl‘. Suebis
also olearly tlre interpretation of Cioere. “Hoe in genere
praeeipiendum nobis videtur, primum, ut illud quod
induremus per similitudinem, ejusmodi sit, ut sit neeesse
eoncedi3 nam ex quo postulabimus nobis illud quod
dubium sit oonoedi, dubium esse idipsum nou oportebit.
Deinde illud eujus confirmandi eausa fiet Inductio, viden·
