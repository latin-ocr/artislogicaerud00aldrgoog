authors have rightly or wrongly divined the purpose of
Aristotle's elassifieation. Kant is mistaken in supposing ,
that Aristotle added the post-predioaments to complete

so oalled by Aristotle, and have never been olassed by
nommentators among the Cetegories. The term is of
scholastio origin, and was employed to denote the five
subjecte treated of by Aristotle after the Gategories
proper. Kant is equally mistaken in supposing that
Aristotle had any intention of elassifying the pure forms
of the understanding, independent of experienee. On
the contrary, the Cetegories belong to the matteras
thought, are generalized from experienoe, and leave
altogether untouehed the psyohologieal question of the
existence of elementa ὰ priori& Any objection, there-

amisapprehension of the philosopher‘s design. Nor yet
oan we adopt Mr. Mill’s opinion, that Aristotle designed
a elassifioation of all things capable of being named3 at
least not in that point of view in whieh things are
regarded aoeording to their real characteristica as pre-
sented to eonsoiousness. The Oategories are rather an
enumeration of the different modes of naming things,
elassified primarily aooording to the grammatioal dis·
tinetione of speeoh, and gained, not from the observation
