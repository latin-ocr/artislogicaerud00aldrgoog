defendere. For the Potitio Prhrer'pii being in that case
a particular mi‘sapplication of the syllogistic meth0d‚ and
postulating the latter as a condition cf ita practicability,
they have inverted the relation of prior and posterior, and
assumed Petitr'c Pniceipia' tc be necessary to the existence
of Syllogism.

But if, on the other hand, there are nc such casea,
and the Syllcgism is in consequence hencefcrth to bc
banished from Philosophy, what do we gain in ex-
change? We reduce the Laws of Thcught from neces·
sary to contingent. We degrada certainty into proba·
bility, and can claim for that only a subjective validity.
But until this latter hypothesis is proved, the Syllogism,
whatever may be its errore cr deficiencies, cannot ba
comprehended under any one cf the fallacias admitted
tc be auch hy the Lapicice. And this is sufficientes a
defence of his own consistency. His method may be an
incorrect analysis of the laws of the reasoningprocess3 it
may be that there are no such lawa at all. But of either
cf these positions the caea probacdc' lies with the assail-
ants, not with the defendere of the Syllogisma ’11 is quite
enough for the Logician, if he exhibit all that is generally
considered valid reasoning in a syllogistic form. If any
maintain that a simpler or better type is attainable‚ he
waits with patience till they produce it. If all reasoning
is fallacious‚ he may be contented to behold his theorias
fall iu the general overthrow of all human knowledge.
But, pending the decision cf this question, he may leave

Syllogism, Archbishop Whatcly replica, that it lies accinat cll argumenta

argument whatever, stated regularly and at rull length. And thie reply ic
substantielly valid, even ifwa reject thc Archbishcp's mode ol exhibiting
Induction aa aSyllogisni in Barbara. For the objection ol Gampbell‚ ir
valid at all, lies against all formal rcaaouing; and logical Induction, in ita
uua analyais, ia cqmlly formal with tha syllogism.
