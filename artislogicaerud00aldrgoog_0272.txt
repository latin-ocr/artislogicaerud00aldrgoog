Secondly, it may be observed that the Enthymeme is
not necessarily confined to the Rhetorica] kind of matter.

Asyllogism from lihelihoods or signs, whatever be the
object, isan Enthymeme. In like manner, any syl·
logism in probable matter may beoome an instrument of
Dialeotio reasoning; whether it be based on the general
probabilities whioh Dialeotio materially furnishes, or on
more limited assumptione drawn from speoial observ·
atione. The Physieian, for example, within the field of ¹
his own experienoe, may know that in nine oases out >
often where a patient exhibita oenain symptoms‚ 'the
disease terminatos fatally. The student of history may
learn thet in the majority of oases revolution leads to
· anarohy‚ and anarohy is suppressed by despotism. Either
of these may beoome the basis ofa reasoning process
· in probable matter, but the Syllogism or Enthymeme is
not, properly speaking, Dialeotioal or Rhetorical, but
Medioal or Politioal. 'And although there is nothing in
the Dialeotioal or Rhetorioal Method that prevents its
being applied to these or any other special subjeets, yet
in proportion as any one so applies it, Aristotle regards
him as departing from the legitimate mutter of Dialeotie
or Rhetorio, and adopting that of some definite Art or
Seienoe¹. For the same reason, when he speaks of the
special applioation of Rhetorio to Politieal deliberation,
he warns us that its objeet matter must not be oonsi-
dered as that of Rhetorio per re, but as primarily and
properly belonging to Politios, secondarily only to
Rhetorio in one of its praetioal applioationsfl.
