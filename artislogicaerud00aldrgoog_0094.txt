potentially divisible into A which is B, and A which is not B;

members includes under it really existing individuale or not.
Logically‚ the division ol animal into mortal and immortal is
as good as that into rational end irrational. But this division
is not strictly formal; for B, the dividing attribute, not being
part of the comprehension of A, has to be sought for out of
the mere act of thought, alter Ahas been given. Thisbes
been observed by Hoffbauer and Fries, who hence rightly
maiatum, against Kant‚ that even dichotomy by contradiction
is not an act of formal thinking. of. Hoffbauer‚ Lepid, ς. 138.

The only strictly fonnal process of this kind is that
distinguished as Determinatim which consists in the reunion of
a genus and difference previously elicited by analysis from
a given concept. Formal Division thus presupposes Defi-
nition. See Drobisch‚ Neue Darrtellunqder Loqilc, ς. 17, 29, 30.

“¹ Excipit. The reason of this order is given by Abelard:
“Quoniam vero divisiones definitionibus naturaliter priores
sunt, quippe ex ipsis constitutionis suae originem ducunt, in
ipso quoque tractatu divisiones merito priorem locum obtine-
bunt, definitiones vero posteriorem.'' Dialectica, ed. Cousin.
p. 450. This is true in' a material point of view; the matter
of a definition being sometimes gained by division. But
formally‚ the reverse order is preferable; aformal division
'or determination being only possible after definition. See
the lastnote.
