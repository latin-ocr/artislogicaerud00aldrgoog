As a commentator, Albert was the main instrument
in introducing the writings of Aristotle into the Sohools;
his laborious expositione, however, have been frequently
corrupted hy Platonie and Arabian glosses¹. His logion]
works are oomprised in eommentaries on the Organou,
and treatisesou Universals and ou Definition. Aquinas
has left also commentarios on the Hermoneia and
Posterior Analytios3 and some independent logioai
treatises; the prinoipal one being “Summa totius
Logiaae,” whiuh ooutains an obstruet of the isagoge of
Porphyry and of the first four treatises of the Organon.
The Topios and Sophistio Refutetions are omitted in
this work3 but the latter form the basis ofa separate
treatise ou the Falleaies. He has likewise written
Opusoula on Demonstration, on Modals, on the four
Opposed Terms, on Genus and Areeident, aud on the
Nature of the Syllogism. The diraetly logical writinga ·
of Aquinas do not materially differ· from Aristotle. Logia,
however, is defined as amentia rationalia, aud the three
operatione of the reason are brought within its proriuae.
Some of the mnemonio formulae oeeur here, as in
Hispanus.

John Duns Suetus, the Subtle Ductor, flourished at
the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the four·
teenth oentury. He has commented on the isagoge of
Porphyry, under the title of De Universalem, and on
the several parts of the Organon. In common with
Aquinas, he held Logia to be a soienee3 but maintains
that its objeot is not the three operatione of the reason,
but the Syllogism⁵. His aommentaries bear out his
cognomen; consisting for the most part of minute dis-
tinetione, suggested by the text of his author, with argu·
ments on both sides preoisely stated, and distinetione
