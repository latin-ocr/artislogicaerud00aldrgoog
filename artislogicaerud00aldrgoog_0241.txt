We hare next to consider the Definitions of Sub·
stances. Here too the investigation of cause is the
root of the whole inquiry; but the manner in which it
is conducted is not at first sight so obvious as in the
former case. To usk the cause of an attribute, is to ask
why the subject is so affected. Why, for example, is the
moon eclipsed? But what is meant hythe coare of a
man, and in what form will the question be proposed?
To ask why man exists, is in fact to ask why there are
such belngs iu the world,-a question admitting only of
Grengousier's solution trend, when so selred, contri-
butirig nothing towards the Definition. Το ask why a
man is e man, is, as Aristode himself observes, futiles
The only form in which the question ean be put is, Why
is this or that individnal a man? What are the essential
constituents of the notion Men, the possession of which
entitles Socrates to be rechoned in the classi Here too
the formal cause determines the Definition.

These Definitions form the first of the three kinds
distinguished in Anal. Post. ii. 10. 4. Ἔστιν ἄρα ὁρισμὸς εἷς»

to the nature of the object to be defined ².
