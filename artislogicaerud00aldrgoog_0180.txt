‘¹ The Meriones Doctrina is not in the sume sense a process
oi inferente from knpwn to unknown; for the parts are sup·
posed to be known already to the toacher, and are methodically
arranged lor the benedt of the learner. This then corresponds
rather to Order than to Method in the proper sense. It may
be an arrangement either of the whole or of a portion ofa
subject; and is thus either universal or particular. cf.
Zabarella, de Methodis‚ lib. ii. cap. 20. The distinction
between the Perfect and Imperfect Method is not usually
recognised by writers on the subject. Aldrich is thinking of
the acronmctie and cacteris teaching cf Aristotle and others;
the characteristic feature of the latter being the suppression ¹
oi certain doctrines as not fitted for apromiscuous audience.
Whereas the universal and particular Methods merely relate
to the whole end the perte in the same exposition.

⁰ On Synthesis and Analysis‚ and the various enrployment
os both, some remarks will be found in the Appendix‚ note G.
The noticn cs Synthesis in the present passage corresponds
to that ol Metaplrysical parts aud whole, which is there men-
tioned aa applicable to a syllogistic process horu a general
principle tc its particular applicatione. Not so that of Analysis;
which in the present passage is also aprocoss froin the universal
to the particular, not from the particular to the ruriversal.
By sctjeorem is meant the most general Subject whose pro·
perties the Science investigates; as Magnitudo in Geometry.
