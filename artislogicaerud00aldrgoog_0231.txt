ration of the several genera under which Aristotle's four
heads of predicables fall. 8. As an enumeration of the
different modes in which Being may be signified. An
examination of the principle of classification is neces-
sary, in order that we may determine how far the charges
of deficiency and redundaucy, so frequently brought
against Aristotle's list, are fairly teneble against it.

The most celebrated of these accusatione is that of
Kant·. Assuming that Aristotle's dcsign was identical
with his own, viz. to enumerate the' pure or aprica
conceptione of the understanding, he asserts that the
classifioation was made upon no principle ; that it was
found by the author to be defective, and the post·

enlarged is still defective, that it contains forms of the

² sensibility as well as of the understanding3 (quassasti,

ritca, prius, aimul,·) that empirioal notions are intruded
among the puro (motus), and deduced concepts olassed as
original (actio, parsic); and that some original elements
are altogether omittedl.

A somewhat similar criticism is given in Mr. Mill’s
Logic. The Gategories he supposes to be “an enume-
ration of all things, capable of being named3 an enume-
ration by the summe qaaere, i. e. the most extensive
classes into which things could be distributed3 which
therefore were so many highest Predicates, oue or other
of which was supposed capable of being affirmed with
truth of every nameable thing whatsoever.” Thus viewed‚
he prouounces the list to be both redundant and de·
factive. Action, passion, and local situation, ought to
be included under relatiou3 together with position in
time, (quenda) and in space, (ubi),· while the distinction
