The Conclusion being supposed to be a known false· ι
hood.

This modo oi reasoning, as exhibited by Aristode,
does not direetly appear in the same form as the former.
For in this the hypothesis is apremt'sm the conclusion
being the impossibility whieh has not been previously
euuneiated. ln the former, the premises are both new
assumptions3 the eonelusion being the anteoedent of
the conditional proposition whieh rvas agreed upon as
a hypothesis. Both, however, agree thus far, that the
syllogistie portion of eaeh does not differ in form from
an ordinary syllogism 3 and that in neither is the original
question syllogistieally proved.

The notiees of these Syllogisms in Aristotle are, it
must be eonfessed, sufficiently seanty. Thus muoh,
however, may fairly be gethered. Firstly‚ that, as
regards form, they are merely the common (lategorieal
Syllogisms applied to a partieular purpose. Seenndly,
that their eonolusiveness‚ as regards the original
question, is by way of material, not of formal, eonse-
quenoe. The syllogism by agreement obviously refers
to dialeetie disputation, and furnishes the grounds for
a mere argumentum ad homiaem, in consequenee of a
previous admission. Apart from this special appli-

, oetion, uhioh does not appear in the syllogism, the

proof amounts to this:

No X is 0;
All X ie A ;
Thoresore, Some A is not O.
Thoresore, (by material consequence.) Some Α ia not B.

lu the ἀπαγωγὴ εἰς τὸ ἀδύνατον, the proof is of the same
eharaeter. It bes indeed no speeial reference to Dialeetio‚
and is frequently employed in demonstration‘3 Aristotle’s

‘For the prineiple of oontradietion may be assumed ae seli-evident,
vdthout any eonventlon between disputante. And in this lies the pn'neipal
