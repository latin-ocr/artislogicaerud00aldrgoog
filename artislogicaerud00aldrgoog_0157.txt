course, only a hypothetical in the loose sense of the above
definition. In the same sense were admitted tcmpmal hypo-
theticals, “When Ais B, G is D,” lotan, “ Where A is B,
C is D,” dre. dre. The causal hypothetical proposition is really
a curtailed hypothetical syllogism. “Because A is B, G is D,”

is equivalentto“ If A is B,Gis D, andAis B.'’ Cf. Hoff- ⁵ ,

‘¹ Nothing can be more clumsy than the employment of the
word conditional in a specific sense, while its Greek equivalent,
hypothetica, is used generically. In Boethius, both terms are
properly used as synonymous and generic; the two species
