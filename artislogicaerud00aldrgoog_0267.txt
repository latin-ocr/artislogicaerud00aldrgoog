210 sensuum.

instance given above, may we not eall the fact that “ this
man envies,'' a ripn that he hales, as well as the general
statement a likelihood? Does not the whole distinction
depend on the question, which is the stated, which the
eroppressed, premise?

To this it may be replied, that Aristotle distinguishes ⁹

the εἰκὸς and σημεῖον merely as propositione, and no where
says that they may not be combined in the same syllogism.
In the instance given, it so happens that the minor premise
is a singular proposition, and may fairly be considered a
ripn of the conclusion. But we might obviously employ
a minor promise of another kind, such as, “All malig÷
nant men are envious ;’' in which case there is, properly
speaking, no ripn employed in the reasoning. But this
does not effect the distinction between the two Pro-
positione. A lihelihood is such, per se,-—a proposition
stating a general truth, which we are at liberty to apply
or not to particular cases. A sign is a sign of something
else,-a single fect stated as aproof of something further3
which proof may, according to material circumstances, be
logically or only morolby conclusive.

Another question sometimes raised is, “ If the En·
thymeme has both premises supplied, how is it to be
distinguished from the Dialectie Syllogism?'’ To which
it may'be answered, that, taking the word Syllogism in
its strictest sense, as a reasoning logically correct, the
same argument may in different points of view be oon·
sidered either as a Syllogism oran Enthymeme. This
is, 'of course, only the case with the τεκμήριοη the other
specimens of the Enthymeme being logically invelid.
The argumentation ἐκ τεκμηρίου is in this sense both
an ‚Enthymeme end a Syllogism3—an Enthymeme on
material grounds, inssmuch as its premise is a rign
of its conclusion ;-a Syllogism on formal grounds,
inasmuch es it eomplies with the conditione of logical
