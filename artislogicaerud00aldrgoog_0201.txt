aristam excidit, vel io quo aon erat. Sed neutrum
iorum ‚· Ergo non omnino. Diodori argumento
breviter et perspicue respondet Gassendus, Quod
movetur moveri a loeo in quo erat, per lorum in
quo est (sive quem pertransit), od locum in quo
nondum est, sed futurum est ¹³.

3. Rucrraocuu vocat Argumentum Gellius, quod
Graece dicitur Ἀντιστρέφονε cui illustrando con-
ficta est Fabula quae Graecorum vanitatem olet.
’ Narrant enim inter Protagoram et Euathlum, vel
(ut facetiae locus sit) inter Coracem⁰ et Tisiam
convenisse, ut hunc ille Dialecticam doceret;
idque hac lege, ut dimidium mercedis statim ac-¹
ciperet3 reliquum, oum discipulus causam vicisset.

¹³ The true solution of the sophism of Diodorus is, thet the
disjunctive promise is false. ‘⁸ The pleae where a body is‚'’
is contradictory of “the place where a body is not ;'' as
“ Englishmen'' is contradictory of “ not-Englishmen;'' but
‘⁴ moving in the place where it is,’' is no more contradictory
. oi “moving in the plaee where it is not,” than “an army com· =
posed of Englishmen” is contradictory of “ an army composed
of notEnglishmen.” As it would be false to say, “every army
must be composed of Englishmen or notEnglishmen‚” to the
exclusion of the third possibility of a mixed soree, so it is
false to say, “ Every body must move in the plaoe where it
is, or in the plaoe where it is not,” to the exclusion of the
third possibility of moving partly in the one and partly in
the other. This solution is substantially given by Hobbes‚
Philosophia Prima, P. II. c. 8. ξ. ll.

⁰ The story is told of Protagoras and Euathlus by Aulus
Gellius, v. 10. and by Apuleius, Florid. iv. 18. ; of Corax, by

Sext. Empir. adv. Math. p. 81. cf. Menag. ad Diog. Laert.
