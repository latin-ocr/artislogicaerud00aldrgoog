A Macrinus Consaocarvca is defined by Aldrich tc be
cuein which the conclusion follows from the premises
solely by the force of the terms. This in fact means,
from some understood Proposition or Propositicns, con·
necting the terma, by the addition cf which the mind is
enabled to reduce the consequence to logical form. This
is easily seen, both in Aldrich’s example, “Homo est
animal, Ergo est vivens‚’‘ and in the rather more ccm-
plicatcd instance given by Sanderson, “Socrates est
risibilis, ergo, Aliquis homo est rationalis.” Tho latter,
when the necessary conditions are supplied, is expanded
into two syllogisms.

Omne risibile est rationale;
Socrates est risibilis,

Ergo, Socrates est rationalis.
Socrates est homo,

Ergo, Aliquis homo est rationalis.

The failure therefore of a Material consequence takes
place when no such connection exista between the terms
as will werrant us in supplying the premises required:
i. e. when one or more cf the promises so supplied would
be fahe. But to determine this point is obviously
beyond the province cf the chicien. For this reason,
Material Consequence is rightly excluded from chic.
Moreover‚ even where true premises can be added,
end the Consequence legitimately deduced, we cannot,
except from knowledge cf the matter, determine into
what form the reasoning will¹ naturally fall. In some
cases, as in the example above quoted from Sanderscn,
