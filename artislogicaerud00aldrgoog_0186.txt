Solutio Sophirmctum.

ᾗ. l. Cuiuscuucuu syllogismi difficultas ad duas .
Species revocari poterit3 alteram, quae in Argu·
menti Materia, alteram, quae in Formo consistit:
namqui has duas expedire noverit, is in tertia, quae
ex ambarum complexione oritur, non haerebit.

⁸ The exominotion of Follecies is extrologicol, except when
the consequence is formolly involid3 in which cose it moy be
detected by the ordinary rulcs of syllogism. 'Phe following
Sophisms ore not oll susceptible of this solution. They ore
mostly material fallaciee‚ srising from ambiguity of longusge
or fulsity of assertion. But they ere not treated of by Aristotle
as belonging to the Science of Legio, but to the Art of Dio·
lectic, of which, es hus been before observed, sconsidereble
portion is material. In fact, Aristotle's Treotise mol σοφιστικῶν
Ιλίγχων is merely on account of the pseudo-refutatione prin·
cipolly in use among the Sophiste of his dey, whether depend-
ing upon equivoocl longuege, false assumption, or illogical
reesoning. In relotion to Logic, it hos little more thuna
historicsl velue. A strictly logical clossificution 0f follscies
should commcnce by distinguishing, in oll the three operatione
of thought, between the matter which is given to, ond the form
which is given hythe thinking oct. Acts of conception, judg·
ment, or ressoning which violate the lawe of thought, ond ore
therefore defective in form, should be clussed es logical fol·
lecies; those which are faulty in the conditione preliminory

to the oct of thought should be clossed es material. See
further, Prolepomenc Βορέω, p. tet.
