of Meyer's Logic is the foundation cf that of Kant
himself ¹.

Lambert, whose Neues Orpenna appeared in 1764,
may be regarded as uniting in a great measure the
doctrines cf the antagonist schocls ci Locke and Leibnitz,
and as the precursor of the Critiquc of Kant. His
system is dirided into four principal parts, contributing
conjointly to the investigatiou and communication of
tnrth: Diuuciolcqy, or the doctrine of the laws aud
powers of the understanding in thought3 Alethiclcyy, or
the doctrine of truth as opposed to error, Semictic, or
the doctrine of signs and their influence on the know·
ledge of truth3 and Pheaomerroloyy, or the doctrine of
’ false appearances aud the means of aroiding them. In
his first part, he priucipally follows Wolf, but differs
from him in his riew of the Syllogistic figures; the
three last figures being regarded as resting on inde·
pendent axioma, coordinata with the dictam dc omui ct
nullo. These axioms are distinguished as dictam de
diverso, dictam de amplo, aud dictum de reciproco. ln
his second part, which treats of simple aud complex
notions, aud of truth and error, Lambert aclmowledges
his obligations to Locke. In the third, the theory
of lauguage and its relation to thought is treated with
considerable fulness. The fourth part, which treats
of appearance as distinguished from reality, has more
of a metaphysical and psychologiaal thau of a logical
character. with some mixture of physiology.

Kant has done more for logical soience than any
philosopher since Aristotle ; partly in his distinct
treatise on the subject, and still more in the exact
examination of the forms and furrctious and limits of
thought which runs through the critique of Pure Reason.
