10 0000 passages, speaking in astrioter sense, Aristotle
declares Substances alone to be capable 01 Definition⁸3
butin the wider sense 01 the term which prevails through*
out the Posterior Analytics, it is applicable both to
Substanoes and to Attributes. In both cases the inquiry
into the Definiticn 01 a thing is identical with that into
its cauee; with this distinction, that in the case of
Attributes, the Oause is to be sought, not in the Attr·ibut0,
but in its Subject; whereas iu the case 01 Substances
which exist per re, the (lause is to be scught in themselves
onlyl.

Attributes are defined by the same cause which served
as amiddle term to prove their existence. This is the
mode 01 Definition described as συλλογισμὸς τοῦ τί ἐστι,
πτώσει διαφέρων τῆς ἀποδείξεως. As an example, he gives ,
the definiticn 01 00 eclipse. The moon is proved to be
eclipsed, because the sun's light is intercepted by the
earth. The same cause furuishes· us at once with a

middle term for demonstration, and with a definition of
the attribute ¹. Why is the moon eclipsedl Because

From this it will be seen that Mr. Mill has unjustly accused Aristotle 01
maintaining that the science 01 Geometry is deduced from Definitions.
(Mill’s Logia, vol.i. p. 197.) Ηο000 may also be explained the contradiction
which Stenart professes to find in Aristotle’s doctrines. (Elements, Pt. ii.
cb.8.sect.i.) The principles fromwhich Aristotle demonstratas,areAaiomr,
01 which he gives as a specimen, “Ι1 equale be taken hom equale, the
remainders are equal.” The necessity 01 acumine the existence 01 the
subject is maintained by Aristotle 00 clearly as by Mr. Mill. (11. 0100

variously attempted. The following is given by Aquinas, Opusc. 38.
