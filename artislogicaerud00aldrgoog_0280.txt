dum est ut simile iis rebus sit, quas res, quasi non
dubias, ante induxerimns¹.” Quintilian, however, applies
' the term rather to the bringing in, as an inferente, of the
question to be proved. “Nam illa, qua plurimum
Soorates est usna, hano habuit viam3 oum plura inter-
rogasset, quae fateri adversario neeesse esset, novissime id,
de quo quaerebatur, inferebat, oui simile oonoesaisaet ; id
est induodo”.” Another meaning of the Greek ἰπάγιιν
and ἓπαγωγὸς, as well as of the Latin inducere and in-
ductio, might seem to point rather to the persuading and
influenoing the mind of the hearern. But the first deriva-
tion ia preferable. The question, however, as far aa
Aristotle is oonoerned, is not of any great oonsequenoe.
For, aa that Philosopher did not invent the name, but
only modified the usage of a term current among hia
predecessore, the etymology will be of little serviae
towards illustrating the notion whioh he attached to it.
