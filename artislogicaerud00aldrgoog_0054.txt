dealing with finite objects; the philosophy of the infinite
being based on their abrogation.

Itis not easy to give in a short compass an account
oi Hegel's Logia, which shall be intelligible to an English
render. If wawere to describe it aa au attempt to
develope a Philosophy of Beiug in general, by repro-
ducing the Divino Thought in tho act of Greation, we
might support the new by sufficient quotations from the
work3 but it would couvey an erroneous impression to
,oue who did not bear in mind tho total suppression of
personality, divine ae. well as human, in the Hegelian
philosophy. It may perhaps be better characterized as
nn illegitimate expausion of the fundamental principle
oi the Gartesian philosophy, modified iu some degree by
the Kantian. ‘⁴ Cogito, ergo sum'’ is true within the
limits ofthe persona] consciousness. Ι exist only in so far
es Iam conscious of my existenoe; and Iam conscious
only as being affected iu this or that determinate manner,
Within theselimits Thought and Beiug are identical, and
every modificatiou of the one is a modification of the other.
But if the same principle is to be accepted iu its Hegelian
extent, l must commence by ascending from my per-
soual consciousness to a supposed Universa] Thought,
identical with Beiug iu general. Here personality dis-
appears altogether ; and the problem is, to deduce from
the identity of Thought and Beiug in general, the several
identical determinatione of the one and the other. Such
a process is not thought, but its negation. If the Uni-
versa had one consciousness, the system might be
possible; for Thought and Beiug are identical only in
and through consciousness. But such universal con·
soiousuess could not be my consciousness3 and thus
the Hegelian assumption cannot be grasped by any act
of human thought. On tho other hand, thought without
consciousness is inconceivable3 since it implies a ne-
