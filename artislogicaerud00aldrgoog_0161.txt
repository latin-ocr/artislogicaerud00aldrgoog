every disjunctive proposition. We may hoppen to lmow that
two altematives cannot be true together, so that the affirmation
of the second necessitates the deniel of the first, and the
affirmation of the first the deniel of the second; but this. as
Boethius observes is a 1111111111, not aformal consequence,
whether it be stated in the hypothetical or disjunctive form.
It must be allowed that the examples sometimes adduced on
this side of the question have not been very happily chosen.
1t sounds oddly enough to state a known truth as a possible
falsehood, as in the instance, “Bellum Trojauum 1111111111
Homerus oet Virqutusss’ But other end more natural specimena
ι have been given3 e. g. ι’1111111111 Troja suit, cut tutoris de
111111 Trojano cst merc sahrde.” The case is still clearer when
both members of the disjunctive are negative, ss in the
example given by Boethius, “Si enim quis dicat, aut non
est album aut non est nigrum, sive elbum non esse as·
sumpserit, non necesse erit esse vel non esse nigrum3 sive
nigrum non esse assumpserit, ut sit vel non sit elbum, nullam
saciet necessitatem.’' On this supposition only two of the
above syllogisms are valid, which may be reduced to hypothe· -
ticals as follows:

Constructive. Destructive.

C is D. Ais B.
