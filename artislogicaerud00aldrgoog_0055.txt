Speculativc philosophy has had three great periods,
each of which has been consummated by a critical
system of which Formal Logic has been a constituent
portion. The Eleatic and Platonic metaphysica found
their consummation in Aristotle5 the Scholastic Philo·
sophy in Occam3 that of the serenteenth and eighteenth
centurias in Kant. But from the Kantian philosophy
has arisen another· phase of speculation, not less dogmatic
in its positionS, not less extravagant in its aims, not less
unstable in its foundations. A criticism which shall sift
thoroughly the pretensions of this philosophy, it romain-s
for the present generation to accomplish.
