Universal Propositious. It will be suffiaient, however, for
my present pmpose to observe that, unless the establish-
ment of an Universal Proposition requires an explioit
and oonsoious examination ol every existing and also of
every possible particular instance, uo aharge of Petitio
Priuoipii, or even of vain repetition, ean be maintained
against the Syllogism. Those who maintain the ante·

knowledge oan or need be attempted.

With regard to the syllogism ofproos, we may examine
the question a little more olosely. The Petitio Prinoipii
is a material, not a formal fallaoy, and oonsists in
assuming, in demonstration, a nou-axiomatis prinoiple
as animatio, or in dialectis disputatiou, a non-probable
prinoiple as probabat It does not affeot the form of
the reasoning3 but depende on the selention of promises,
when the syllogism is employed for the particular
purpose of proos, demonstratiws or dialeotio. Those
are guilty of it who do not adopt such promises as the
laws of the two prooesses require; in the oue osse,
propositions axiomatis or deduoible from axioms3 in the
other, probable statements‚ sanationed hythe general
opinion of mankind or the authority of eminent persona.

ln reading Aristotle's aooount of this fallaoy, it is
evident that -the whole point of the matter lies in the word
αἰτεῖσθαι, or suplicium and that the question to be asked
is, not whether the premises virtually eontain the oon-
