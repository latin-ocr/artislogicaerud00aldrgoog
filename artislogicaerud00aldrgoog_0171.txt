ῑ On the history ol the terms Oby‘ect and Subject, Objeetiuc
and Subjectiue‚ see Sir W. Hamilton's note, Reid's Worles,
p. 806. and Trendelenburg Elementa, ᾗ. l. The variations
between the scholastic and the modern sense of these terms
are however in this particular relation unimportant. Where
buculedpe or certainty is spoken of, the subject of inherence
(in the scholastic sense) is the mind as knowing; and the
object proper is the thing as known; and thus far, the
modern use of the same terms is nearly coincident; though
when viewed out of relation to the actos knowledge, the two
nomenclatores are exactly the reverse of each other. In our
present point of view we may distinguish certitudo objecti asa
quality of tlte proposition aa apprebcuded hythe mind, and certi·
tudo subjecti as u stote eff tlte mind us appreheudiup tlte proposition ,·
and in this sense the two are inseparablc lrom each other,-
being only the same actos thought viewed from opposite
sides This is the only sense of objeu and subject with
which Logic has any concern. The subjective munte, as the
schoolmen would call it, or the objeuiu existence, as the
moderns would call it, of things out of the act of thought,
belongs to a metaphysical inqniry, with which, as logicians, we
have no concern.
