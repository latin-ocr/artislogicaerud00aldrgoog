rumque duo (etsi interdum plura) proponit adver-
sario capienda3 quorum utrumvis acceperit, causa
cadet. Tale est illud Biantis, Si acorem ducos
formosam, hebebis coraja, communem· si deformem,
ποινὴν, poemom .· ergo Nullo est ducendo&

¹Hoc non valet, nisi ita comparetur, ut partem
alteram accipi sit necesse; utraque autem feriat;
nec possit retorqueri. Quae si vidisset Bias, suo
sibi Dilemmate minus placuisset; neque enim vel
formosa uxor vel deformis necessario futma est;
sed est media quaedam pulchritudo, quam Ennius

III. Destructive, (always Complex.)

IfAisB,GisD; andifEisF,GisH;
But either Ο is not D, or G is not H;
EitherAisnotB, orE is not F.

There cannot be a simple destructive Dilemma of this kind,
as is shown by Abp.Wl1ately, Logic, b. ii. ch, 4. j. b.

There is another form of reasoning, sometimes called
Dilemma, which is also a hypotheticodisjunctive reasoning,
but which, instead of having the major promise hypothetical¹
and the minor disjunctive, has both combined in the major;
theothole of the disjunctive consequente being denied in the
minor. E. g. “If A is B, either C is D, or Eis F; but
neither C is D, nor Ε is F; therefore A is not B.'' This
form is given by Wallis, lib. iii. cap. 19.; as well as by Wolf
and Kant. But it is a perversiori of the Dilemma. proper, and
introduces no distinction whatever; being merely a common
disjunctive syllogismos is shewn by Wallis himself. Itis,
in fact, the enumeratio, not the complexio, of Cicero.

k See Gellius Noct. Att. v. ll.

¹ These remarks entirely relate to the matter, and have
nothing to do with the Logical character, of the Dilemma.
See Whately, ii. 4. 6.
