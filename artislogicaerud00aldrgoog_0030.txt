rioal notices which they firrnish of philosophers whose
original contributione to the sciense have perished.
Of the extant Greek Commentators, the earliest and
hest is Alexander of Aphrodisiasl, whose eminenoe is
testified by the title of tlte commentator (ὁ limfis), a
title afterwards given to the Arabian Averroes. The
school of Greek Commentators extends to the latter
part of the sixth century: the prinoipal writers, after
Alexander, ere l'hemistius, Ammonius, David the
Armenian, Simplicius, and Philopouus.

The only important addition to the matter of logical
soienoe emanated from the Neo-Platonis school. The
εἰσαγωγή or Introduction to the categorias, written by
Porphyry in the third century, is the original source of
the fivefold olessifioation of the Predicebles, adopted by
most subsequent Logioians. Whether this classification
is an improvement cn, or consistent with, the Aristote-
lian doctrine, admits of considerable question ⁰.

The Greek Abridgments cf Aristotle, though in point
of chronology they extend below the scholastio period,

, are in matter rather connected with the preceding series

cf Commentators. While the Scholastic Logio began
in the extreme west of Europe, the Greek Logioians of

this class belong entirely to the extreme east, or tc
Asia. John of Damascus, in the early part of the eighth

century, made a brief analysis ol the Isagoge ol
Porphyry and of the Cetegories, and is remarkable as

b Galen, in point ol time, is a few years earlier than Alexander, but nc
important commentery of his is extant. Ol the numerous logical writings
attributed to him, there remeius only s small hennae, περὶ τῶν παρὰ τὴν
λέξιν σοφισμάτων, the genuineness ol which is questioneble; to which may
be added the Eloayoyh Διαλεκτική recently discovered end published by
M. Mynas. Neithcr is cl any great logical velue. Galen’s inventiones
the l'onrth figure of Syllogism (attributed to him by Averroes) is doubtful.
