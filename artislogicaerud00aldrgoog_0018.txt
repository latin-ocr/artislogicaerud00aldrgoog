which the science of Logic is principally derived, it is
remarkable that there is no single neme sanctioned by
the Stagirite himself, under which can be comprehended
either the whole collection of trectises known hythe
name of the Organon, or the whole subject oi which they
treat. Λογικὴ, as the name of an art or science, is not to

λογικῶς, are used in a very different sense from that
which has subsequently been giren to them⁸. The
lopical cyllopirm of Aristotle is opposed sometimes to the
analyticcl, sometimes to the physical syllogism3 and
significa a process of reasoning from general principles
of probability, ae distinguished from one of which the
principles are elicited by special contemplation oia
given object or notioni. It is therefore opposed, alilre
to the demonstrative reasoning, in which necessary
truths are resolved into the axiomatic principles on
which they depend, and to that by which physical
phenomene are referred to general lawe oi nature.

science, is probably later than Aristotle, and to be re-
