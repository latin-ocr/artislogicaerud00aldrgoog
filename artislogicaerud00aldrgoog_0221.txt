Universal‚ but susceptible of Accidents, from which union
are formed various Individuals. Man, for example, is
a lowest species: to this are added certain accidente]
modificatione which form Socrates, and at the same
time others which form Plato. These modificatione
excepted, there is nothing in Socrates which is not
at the same time in Plato, nor in Plato, which is not
at the same time in Socrates ¹. Moreover, from these
Universal Substances, or rather from the distinctive por-
tion of each, certain qualities floro, or are produced as
effect from cause. Others, not connected by caesarien,
are found in the individuale οἱ this or that Species, some
universally in all, others partielly, in some individuale
only.

From a series oi assumptione of this kind, the expo·
sition of the Reelist doctrine of Predicables ie easy. And
this, or some other οἱ the various phasee of Scholastic
Realism, must of necessity be assumed, if our intention
is to explain en old theory, not to construet a new one.

On the other hand, we have the modern Logician
expounding somewhat in the following style. Genera
and Species have no existence a parte Rei, but are
notione formed by the mind from observing certain
points of similarity in different individuale. But simi·
lerity must not be confounded with identity. The image
and superscription on two coins may present no dis·
cernible marks of distinction from each other 3 but if on

p. cle. This was the first doctrine of William of Ghempeaux. Other
expositione of Reeliem might be given.
