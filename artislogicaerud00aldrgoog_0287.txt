own example being taken from Geometry. But still its
connexion with the original question is not formal, but

materia15 for we assume,
All A is B;

, All G is A ;
Therefore‚ All (l is B.

And this conclusion, from material grounds, we ltnow to
be false. We also know (materially again) that the minor
promise is truc3 and all that is logical in the processis
the consequent decision that the major must be false,
and hence, by the principle of contradiction, that the
original question is true.

But one step only is wanting, to convert these material
consequences into formal ones. We have in the συλλο-
puple ἐξ ὁμολογίας clearly the germ of the Conditional
Syllogisms of Theophrastus. lt needs but to commoneo
with the original hypothesis not as a mere dialectic
conventiou, but as a proposition having its own objective
ralue, and we have at once a distinct form of argu·
mentation, to which the Aristotelian specimen is related
merely as a prosyllogism supporting one of the promises.
This done, no great sagacity is required to see that the
prosyllogism may in this, as in any other case, be omitted Ἴ
or not, according to the material character of the promise
which it supports.

To the ἀπαγωγὴ εἰς τὸ ἀδύνατον may in like manner he
traced the origin cf the Disjunctive Syllogism. The
most natural proceeding in this case is to state the two
contradictory propositions as alternatives, one of them
being disproved by a prosyllogism.

Either Some Α is not B, or All A is B; in which case

All O is A;
Therefore, All G is B.
