physieal fictione connected with it, and te give a seeming
validity to the most potent demonstrationes Risibility as
an emanation from Rationality3 though that emanation
was never dreamed of by Aristotle, and will scarcely claim
implicit belief in the present day. But it is not merely
because the revolution effeeted in this braneh of Science
has invalidated the individual example, that the inter-
pretation is objected to; but because the words of Aris·
totle himself expressly direct us to another criterion.
The Demonstrations ef Geometry are still extant in the
same form in which they existed in the days ef the
Stagirite. Thcugh Euclid himself, the oldest remaining
Geometer, is a few years younger than Aristotler, yet,
except on the very improbable hypothesis that he was
the original inventor of the whole eontents ef his

Elements, that work must be regarded as furnishing a ⁵
fair specimen of the demonstrations treated of in the
Posterior Analyties. By this touohstone, Aristetle and

his interpreters may be tested. When any modern
llerlinus or Dasypediusr shall exhibita single demon-
stration of Euelid in the ferm of a selrolastic deerenstrntie
potissima, we may then recognise this foundling of the
Scheolmen as the legitimate offspring of their masten.

‘r Euelid flourished in the reign os Ptolemy Lagus, B.G. 323-283. This
period, however, probably corresponds to the close, not to the commence-
ment, cf his life. This would make him partly contemporary with, though
about thirty years junior to, Aristetlc.

¹ Os the remarkable work cf these two “ zealous but thiel-heeded
Logieians,” as Sir W. Hamilton calls them, I have not hitherto been enabled
to procuro a sight; but from the allusion to it by the same author, Reid's
Works‚ p. 702, it would seem that their analysis resembled the oue given
above. Indeed‚ it is not easy te conceive how it could be performed in any
otherway.

¹ See cu this point the criticisms ef thnrus, Sedala Muthemotieoe, l. iii.
aml ol' Wolf, Phil. Bet. ξ. 498. Both, however, treet the scholastie serm as
Aristotelian.
