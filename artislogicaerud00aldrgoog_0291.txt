sequence hypothetically, is not to multe it formal, but
only to state that, iu a certain given instance, e. con-
sequence not cognisable by Logic takes place. The
sequence of “O is Β,” from “A is Β,” is not one whit
more logical than it was before; it is only stated to take
place materially in the present case.

The omission of hypotheticnl syllogisms has fre·
quently been blamed as a defect in Aristotle's Orgauon;
and his French translator takes some fruitless paine
to strcin his text, in order to melre out that he does
.in fact trent of them¹. Ifthere is any truth in the
preceding observations, it will folloW, that Aristotle
understood the limits of Logic better than his critics3
and that his translator had better heve allowed the
omission ss a merit than have attempted to deny it as
a fault. When the hypothetical proposition states a.
formal consequence, the reasoning grounded upon it
may always be reduced to categoricel. When it states
a material consequence, it states what the Logician‚ as
such, cannot take into account. Aristotle is therefore
quite right in saying, that in this case the conclusion
is not proved, but concedere. Syllogism may be em· Ἴ
ployed as a logical proos of the antecedent: the con·
sequent is admitted to follow on grounds which the
Logician‚ as such, does not investigate, but which may
be warranted by the principles of this cr that material
sciense.

The true characteres hypothetical reasoning is lost
sight of in the exemplos commonly selected by Logicians,
which hare for their subject a proper neme, and indicate,
not a general relation of reason and consequent between
two notions, but certain accidental circumstances in the
