reasoning. It is a Dialectic Syllogism‚ ii employed for
the purpose of dialectic disputation3 aud, as it usually
relatae to those subjecte tc which dialectie disputationis
practically applied ‘‚ it may in general be regarded as,
potentially at least, dialectic ¹.

In fact, it is not as an Enthymeme, but as a Rhetoricol
'Spibyiana that a given specimen of reasouing is dis·
tinguished from the Dialectical. The object oi the two
arts is distinct. That of Dialectic is to convince the
Intellect; that of Rhetorio, to persuade the Will. The
same instrument may be employed by both, and itis
merely the purpose for which it is employed that con-
stitutas the distinction between theml. thther tha
same means are always avallable for both purposcs;
whether the same informality of reasoning is allowed in
Dialectic as in Rhetorio, must depend on the conditione by
which the disputante in the former choose to biud them-
selves. The Rhetorician has to influencc an audience: if

he can effect this, he will not always be scrupulcus about

¹ This, however, is by nc means necessary. Matters nct usually discussed
either by the Dialectician or Orator may equally be proved by means cl
τεκμήρια. For example; the falling cl the tharmcmcter to 82⁰ is a siqu ot
meaning ; the obscuratiou oi the moon iu eclipse is a slya that the earth's
ahadcvv is intarposed between it and the sun. Such subjecta arc uct
practicclly dialectical, at least in Aristotle’s view of the art. As far aa
the mere interrogatory form is concemed‚ it may be, and vas by different
Philosophers, applied tc all varietiea cf matter.

Ι This proceeds on the supposition that the Dialectician is bound tc
logical accuracy iu his reasonings ; a restrictiori which Aristotle at least
would regard as salutary. Sec Anal. Post. i. 6. 10. We need not however
suppose that all disputante actually ccnlormcd to it
