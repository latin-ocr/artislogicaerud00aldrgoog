an universal conclusion is logically mann in this form,
which is not valid in the third figure of Syllogism.

We see then, thatin the Inductive process the Copula
is ambiguous, expressing in the major promise and in
the conclusion, the relation of a contained part to a
containing whole3 in the minor premise, that of consti-
tuting parts to a constituted whole. Thi· ambiguity has
been remarked as a deficienoy in technioal language⁰3
but there is no term sufficieutly notmalized in Logic to
serve as a substitute to express the latter relation.

On Induction, ar exhibited above, it may be remarked,

Ι. That the distinction between a perfect and an im·
perfect Induction is extralogical. Logio recognises no
inferenoe that is not necessitated by the Laws of Thought:
and therefore it must be presumed that the Induction is
perfect, i. e. that the ludiriduuls mentioned are in reality
rte whole constituente of the species, before the In-
duotive Inferenoe can come in any way within the
province of the Logician. To inquire what is the
warrant for this presumption3 to ask what amount of
observation will warrant usin assuming X, Y, and Z, to
be att the members of the class A3 is like asking in
syllogistic reasoning, how do we know that the promises
are true? undoubtedly a most important question, but
not to be answered by Logio. So also any compromise
with material probability, any statement of the indi·
viduals as comples or adequare representation of their ·
classi, is a surrender of the essential principle of
Logioal Reasoning: the parts ore absolutely thewlrole3
or the inference is, logically speaking, worthless.

It is manifest, however, that the Induction may be
easily stated in such aform, as to transfer the material
