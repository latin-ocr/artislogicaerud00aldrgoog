sometimes limited to Contradictories.
² As Logic cen take no cognisunce ol understood matter, the
“ necessary impossible and contingent'' shouldbe omitted from
the table os Opposition. Itis no part of the province oi the
Logician to determine otoo a given Proposition is materially
true or snlse; but only what formal inferences may be mede
upon the assumption of its truth or falsehood. Hence the
Genons of opposition should be expressed only in the hypo-
theticel form. They may be briefly given thus :-
1. If A is true; Ο is false, E false, and I true.
2. If A is lelse; Ο is true; E and I unknown.
Δ3. Ii E is true; Iis false, A false, and Ο true.
4. Π Ε is felse; I is true; A and Ο unknown.
ὅ. If I is true; Ε is false3 A end Ο unknown.
6. 1f1 is false; E is true, Ο true, und A false.
7. If Ο is true; Ais felse; Ε and Iunknown.
8. If Ο is true; A is true, I true, and E false.
So that from the trullo of an universal, or the falsehood os a par·
ticular, we may infer the occidental quality of all the opposed
Propositions; but from the falsehood of an universal, or tenth
ol a particular, we only know the quality of the contradictory.
