ideas are exclusively ideas of attributes. By reference
then to Aristotle’s account of the latter, it will plainly

' appear that he and Locke mean two very different things

hy Definition. With the former, it is an investigation
of the objectiva cause of a phenomenon3 with the latter,
an analysis of the subjective impression which that
phenomenon produces in the mind. The idea of an
interception of light is not part of the idea eclipse‚ but
the one phenomenon is the physical antecedent and
cause of the other. Inquiries of this kind are still
classed among the most important problems of Physical
Scienoe. What, for example, is light? Is it a succession
of material particleS, or the undulations of an elastic
medium? The solution of this question would not be
a Definition in Locke’s sense of the word3 i. e. it would
not be an analysis of the idea of light produced in the
mind by sensatico. The same may be said of colour.
The mental sensation of whiteness or redness is altogether
unaffected hythe researches of Optics. The external
cause of colonr, regarded as a quality of bodieS, falls
directly within the province of the scienter. The de-
termination of such problems will be, in Aristotle's sense
of the term, Definition.

We are struck with the absence of any thing like a
