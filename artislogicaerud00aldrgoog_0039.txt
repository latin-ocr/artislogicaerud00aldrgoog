1001110011οθ 01 1110 Summulae', called Parva Loyicolr'a,
contains sundry additions to the text 01 Aristode, iu the
form 01 dissertatione on suppositio, ampliatio, restrictio, ex-

11001110 propositione, and other 0001101100, 01010 ingenious
than 1100101, and belonging rather to Grammar than to
Logia. To these are added notiees 01 00100 popular
sophisma, worthy of Eubulidas or Chrysippus; which
010 0011000, 00 01101111131101111080110100110 Legio, like
the Aristotelian, had its eristlo predecessore, whose
names 1110 10111103 literature of the period bas not rescued

We now come to the two chief names in 1110 Scholastic
philosophy, Albert of (1010300, sumamed the Great,
and his pupil‚ Thomas Aquinate, known as⁴ the Angelic
Doctor. These 11010 11000 called the Plato and Aristotle
01 Scholasticism3 aud, as regards the Theology 011110
Sohools, there is some truth 10 1110 comparison. The
master was the first to combine into a system the
uneonnected reasonings which formed the beginnings
01 1110 School Philosophy. The disciple carried out
that system 10 detail, aud elaborated its minutest parts².

Greek work is in reality translated 11010 the Latin3 and 01 000100 10 that
ease falsely attributed to Psellus. The author 01 1110 Summulae appears
to have had very little knowledge 01 Greek3 andin the only mnemonic
which occursinthe Greek synopsis (δουλούμεναι ἲλιάδεςπαρνασίον ἔκτρέχουσι),
the diphthong would hardly 11010 occurred to an original writer3 though

on conjectureby the 0111101,Εο10301. Some remarks on this pointwillbe ,

abridgment 01 1110 0130000 and 1110 Parvo Loptcatta. Subsequent Editors
subdivide it into seven treatises. See Haureau, vol. ii. p. 241.
