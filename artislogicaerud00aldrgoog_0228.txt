A Lowest Species will be inadmissible, as it implies
a notion so complex as to be incapable of further
accessions. It is true that, iu the continual formation of
Species, we may arrive at combinations of attributes not
realised in Nature3 but the classification of things is not
the province of the Logician3 nor has hc a right to con·
clude ὰ priori that the field of physical research is ex·
hausted, or that notions now regarded as imaginary may
not hereafter be discovered to be real. But whether such
discovery be made or not, it will not effect the relation
of two noticns to each other. Logic is concerned only
with the necessary relations of concepts in thought.
Every concept being commento a plurality of objectu,
is potentially divisible into lower ones. Α logical
lowest species, if such were possible, would be a con-
cept embracing all conceivable attributes not condemned
by the laws of thought as contradictory of each other.
This, as well as its opposite the logical highest genus,
or notion so simple as to have no distinctiva attributes,
are mere imaginary limits, never reached in any process
of actual thought⁸. A material science may have its
highest arrd lowest classes, the former being the general
class, embracing all the objects whose properties that
science investigates3 the latter the classes at which that
special investigaticn ends. In Geometry, for example,
under the summum penus of magnitudes in space, we find
three itfimae species of triangles, the equilateral, the
isosceles, and the scalena. The geometrica] propertius
of the figures are not affected by any further subdivision.
But this limitation cannot be aclmowledged by the
Logician. He knows nothing of the geometrical or
