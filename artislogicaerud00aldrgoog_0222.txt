thet account we say thet they are the rome, we employ
the word in en equivocal sense, which must be carefully
distinguished from that in which we say that both are
struck from the same die. ln the letter sense, the
attributes forming the humanity of Socrates are nottho
same with those forming the humanity of Pleto; though
the common notion meo embraees both, and though, by
availing ourselves of an ambiguity of lauguage, we say
that both are of the come species.

Geperel notions thus framed by the mind, when
expressed in language, form common terms. And the
various attributes comprehended¹¹ in every such notion
are its logical essenoe ¹. By this we do not mean any
thing necessary to the physical existence of en objeot;
but merely that, as general notione are formed from
the observation of similar attributes in individuale, every
individual must possess such attributes, if it is to be
included under the extension of the notion and called
by the corresponding common name. Proper names, on
the contrary, hare no esseuce, as they haye no general
notion belonging to thern, but are mere arbitrary marks

distinction I still regard as most important, and one thetis not perhaps
sufficiently marked in modern languagec but further study of the scholastio
phraseology has led me te regard ΜΓ. ΜὶΠέ languege as too wide a

Logical Essenos of other philosophem, though variously explained according
to their different Metaphysical theorias. The term Reoi Euenor is used
