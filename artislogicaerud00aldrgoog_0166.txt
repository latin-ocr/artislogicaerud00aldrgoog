CAP. V.

De Syllogismo quood Materiam.

ᾗ. l. Huc de Syllogismo quoad Formam spec-
tato. J am de eodem quoad Materiam, h. e. Certi·
tudinem et Eaideatiam propositionum ex quibus
componitur.

Certa autem propositio est, cui nihil occurrit
· in contrarium, vel quod occurrit instar nihili est;

¹ This definition is vagus enough: the example, however,
shews more clearly what is intended. For risibile was regarded
as aproperty, flowing from, and demonstrable by, the dil-
serentia rationale. · We may therefore define a certain pro·
position as “a proposition capable of demonstration.'¹ It
will thus be distinguished from an trident proposition, which
is axiomatis and indemonstrable. Both are, of course,
warewarp, which is essential to demonstrative reasoning:
but the former ie the conclusion of a demonstration; the
latter, a promise. Waiving the physical question of the
necessary connection of risibility and rationality, we may
give as examples, of a certain proposition, “The angles ol
every triangle are equal to two right angles ;’' of an evident,
‘⁸ Things which are equal to the same are equal to each
other.”

Such seems clearly to be Aldrioh's meaning in the present
passage; in which certa and aridem correspond to what are
commonly called imnrediuta immediatam suffecti, and immediata
immediatam roasa. (cf. Sanderson, lib. ³. cap. 12. from whom
this part is chiefly taken.) Aldrich’s subsequens language,
however, is by no means consistent
