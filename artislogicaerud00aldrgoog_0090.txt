substances and at all timae. Such properties of the summum
genus are enumerated by Aristotle, (lateg. ch. b. These
were in the scholastic theory regarded as flowing from the
simple essence; those of all subordinate classes from the
differentia.

1 Porphyry‚ following Aristotle, does not distinguish Pro·
party from Accident as flowing necessarily from the essence,
butas coextensive and simply convertible with its subject.
In this heis followed by Boethius; the other distinction, how·
aver, appears as early as in the commentary ofAlbertus Magnus,
and seems to have been deriv'ed from the Arabians. (Cf. Albert
de Predicab. Tract. vi· cap. 1.) The ἴδιον 01 Porphyry answers
to the fourth kind of property mentioned in the text. Tho
other three are occidente: the first and third separable; the
second inseparable‚ but still only an accident, as being pre·
dicable of mora subjecte than tono. On the scholastie theory,
it is also an accident, as not flowing necessarily from rationale,
the differentia. Aristotle, who defines man ζῷον πέζαν δίπουν,
would regard bipes as a differentia. It may be observed that,
upon the principles of Aristotle and Porphyry, a generis
property can only be regarded as a property with respect to
the highest species of which itis predicable. As regards all
subordinate species, it must be considered as an 00011001.
Mobile, for example, a property of corpus, is an accident to
annual, and to horno, as not convertible with them. This may
ba fairly inferred from Top. ii. 3, 1. and is also maintained by
Avicenue and Albertus Magnus: see Albert. de Predicab.
Tract. ix. cap. 1. On the theory of naccnary connexion, it may
romain aproperty; but on this authorities are divided. '
