INTRODUGTION. xv

Two names sanctioned by Aristotle are applicable to
parts, but to parts only, of the Organon. These are
Acalytc'c and Dialectic. The former term is applied by
Aristotle to the four books which 'treet of the syllogism
and of demonstration ¹, and appears to denote the reso·
lution of the reasoning process into its scientifio forms.
This word is the most nearly synonymous with the
modern Loyic of any used by Aristotle himself ; but it
embraces the process 01 Reasoning only, to the exclusion
of Conception and Judgmentl. Dialectic is a word pro-
bably invented by Plat01, though afterwards applied to
the works 01 earlier philosophare, e. g. Zeno the Eleatic.
In its Platonic sense it denoted the highest of all
sciences3 that which takes cognisance of the eternal
and immutable, of being in general and its attributes,
and thus has insight into the universal principles upon
which all other knowledge is dependentm. lt thus
eorresponds in matter, though different in form, with

the first Philosophy or Theology of Aristotle, afterwards
called Metaphysica The name Dialectic had reference

i Galen (dc libris propriis, ch. ll.) says that the title Aualytico is not
Aristoteliam the Prior Analytics being called by their author περὶ συλλο-
γισμοῦ, and the Posterior, περὶ ἀποδείξεως. This testimony is accepted by
M. St. Hilaire, Memoire, p. 42. But tha name ἀναλυτικὰ occurs too
frequently in Aristotle’s own writings to warrant this view, unless we
suppose (which is very improbable) that all the references have been
interpolated by a later hand. Of. Waitz, vol. i. p. 667. Tha distinction,
however, between Prior and Posterior Analytioe is not recognised by ·
Aristotle, and we may perhaps conjecture that tha name ἆναλυτικὰ was
given by him to the entire four books, each division being also distin-
guished by its own title, as mentioned by Galen.

Potitum though he does not give it the name 01 analysis.
