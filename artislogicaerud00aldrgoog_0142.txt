necessary. In the system of Lambert in which each figure
rests on a separate axiom, reduction is impossible; the
process being then the destruction of one distinct reasoning‚
and the substitution of another. By reducing the laws ’01
thought to their simplest form, in which they are applicable ,
10 011 syllogisms directly‚ reduction is superfluous.

⁸ Reductio ad impossibile. This phrase, though sanctioned
by respectable authorities, is incorreet; as may be shewn by

substituting the definition. What is the meaning 01 “ the
change 01 an imperfect to a perfect moed to the impossible ?''
. The error has been caused by the Aristotelian expression,
ἀπαγωγὴ εἷς τὸ ἀδύνατον ,· in Which, however, ἀπαγωγὴ does not
mean reduction. The deductio ad impossibile, as it is usually
rendered, (abductio would perhaps be better.) is one species
01 1110 συλλογισμὸς ἐξ ὑποθέσεως, (see Appendlx, note 1,) tha
object of which is, to prove the truth ofa given problem‚ by ἵ
inserting a salsehood from the 'assumption 01 its contradictory.
This may be employed in the reduction 01 syllogisms, but it
is also used for other purposes, as by Geometers. (Euclid. i. 7.l
The correct expression is therefore Radunrb 0ον deductionem ad
impossibile, or elliptically, Reductio 0ον impossibile. The ἀπαγωγὴ
01 An. Pr. ii. 25. will be explained hereafter.
Any mood may be reduced hythe deductio cd impossibile,
though in practice it is usually confined to Baroho and
Bokardo
