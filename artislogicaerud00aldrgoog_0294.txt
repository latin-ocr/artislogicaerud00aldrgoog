sequent consequence is related as an episyllcgism0. ln
the former case, where B stands fer a physical cause,
the judgment is synthetical, and indicates a material
consequence, which it requires sorne additional know·
ledge cf facts to reduce to formal: e. g. “All wax
exposed to the fire rnclts, because it is exposed.’' Here,
on material grounds, we know that we cannot supply the
premise, “All bodies‘exposed to the fire melt;'' hut
only, “All bodies scluhle by heat and exposed to the
lire melt.” Iu this case the consequence is extralogical,
and requires additional data not given in the thought.
But here also, when the judgment in question is em-
ployed as the premise of a reascning‚ the conclusion
follows categorioally; though the premise itself cannot,
as it stands, be proved by a prosyllogismr.

The Disjunctive Judgmcnt is usually described as
representing a whole divided into two or more parts
mutually exclusive of each other; and the Disjunctive
Syllogism is supposed to proceed either frorn the affirm·
ation of one member to the denial of the rest, or from

the donial of all but one to the affirmaticn of that one,
by the Principle of Excluded Middleq.
