difficulty from the minor promise to the major ; in which
oasa the question may be satisfactorily answered by that
Art or Scienco to which the Proposition materially

belongs. Thus the example given by Aldrioh might be
stated as follows:

The magnete which I have observed, and also those which
Ι have not obser-ved, attract iron;

'Phe magnete which I have observed‚ and those which Ihave
not observed, are all magneta;
''l‘heresora All magneta attraot iron.

In this mode of stating, the minor premise is unde·
niably true. The doubtful partos the major, relating to
the properties of unobserved objecta mustbe determined
by the analogies of the Science to which tho‘ objecta
belong, and by the material inquiry, what kind of
samples or specimens will warrant our asserting oi
others what we have observed in them.

Il. It is precisely in the mode of answering this
material inquiry, that the whole differente lies between
the ancient Inductio pe'r enumerationem simplicem, and
that interpretation of Nature insisted upon by Bacon.
The disciple of the former method, when asked, How do
you know that other specimens oi your class possessthe
same property as thesei will reply, Because Ι hare
never seen one which does not possess it. The Ba·
oonian, on the other haud, will answer, Because l have
selected such instances as give evidence of an universal
lawul have examined those specimens of the class
which have nothing in common, except the possession
of the property in question: Ι have compared thern with
objeots not possessing it, andI find its absence always
accompanied by that of one of the essential attributes
of this class ⁸.
