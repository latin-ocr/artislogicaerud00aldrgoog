can only'bo ono particular promise in a Soritos, the first; the
others being major promises in the first figure. And tho last
is the only promise which moy bo negativo: lor any previous
negativo promise would produce a negative conclusion, which
could not be used as a minor promise in tho next syllogism.

Tho Sorites is not recognised as a distinct kind of reason-
ing by Aristotle. Nor is there any reason why it should have
boen; as it is merely a combination of ordinary syllogismo,
succinctly exprossed. Its distinct exposition is attributed to
the Stoice, But tho principle, as Molanohthon observes is
impliod in Oateg. 3. 1. and the Sorites itself is alluded to in
Anal. Pr. i. 25. 2, ll. There is another form of the SoritoS,
called the repressius or Goelenion, first given by Goelenius in
his Isoyope in Oryonum Aristotelis. In this, the subjectos each
proposition is tho predicato of the next ; the conclusion being·
formed of the last subject and the first predicate. E. g. All '
Dis E, allGis D, ellBis Ο, allAisB; therefore allAis E.
In this, when expanded, the conclusion of each syllogism is
tho major promise of the next. In this Soritos, only the first
promise can be negativo and tho last particular. This, as
Krug has remarkod, should really bo called the propreesioas
the ordinary Soritos tho repressioo. Α much more complicated
theory ol Sorites is given by Horbart‚ Lebrboch zor Philosophia
ξ. 70. and by Drobiseh, Loqile, ξ. 81; but it is of little logical
valuo. ·

The Sorites must not be confoundod with the well-known
fallacy of the same namo, attributed to Eubulidos of Miletus
ond mentioned by (licere, De Divinatione, ii. 11. In laet, tho
name has been loosoly applied to various kinds of reasoning.
