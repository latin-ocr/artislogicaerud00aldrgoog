This conclusion being manifestly false, we have no
choice but to admit the other alternative. The pro-
syllogism iu this ease, as in the former, may be omitted,

if the falsehood of the alternative is evident without it.

We have thus the Disjunetive Syllogism.
We may agree therefore with M. St. Hilaire thus far,

that, though the form of the Hypothetieal Syllogism is not
explicitly exhibited in the extant writings of Aristotle,

· we have nevertheless the data from which it needs but

one step to develope it. Whether that step was taken
hy Aristotle himself in a lost work, or supplied by his
disciples, is a point of little consequence3 though
external testimony is decidedly in favour of the latter
supposition.

Far more importantia a logical point of view, is the
inquiry whether the hypothetical syllogism, by whom·
soever analysed,'is a legitimate addition to the forms
of reasoning ackuowledged in Aristotle’s Organon3 and
consequently, whether its omission can fairly be cen-
sured as a deficienoy in that work. On this question,
Ι find myself oompelled to hold an opinion different
from that of the Logioians whose views have been mainly
followed in the present work.

By Kant and his followers, the Hypothetical Pro·
position is described as representing a form of judgment
essentially distinct from the Gategoriea13 the latter being
thoroughly assertorial, the former problematioal in its
constituent parts, assertorial only as regards the relation
between them. Two judgmentS, each in itself false,
may thus be hypothetieelly combined into a single
truth3 and this combinatiou cannot be reduced into
categorical forma The Hypothetieal Syllogism, in like
manner, is a form of reasoning distinet from the cate-
