envy hate:” the lat-ter is a sinqnlzw Proposition‚ which
however is not regarded as a sign, except relatively to
some other Proposition‚ which it is supposed may be
inferred from it. The εἰκός, when employed in an Enthy-
meme, will form the major promae of a Syllogism such
as the following:

Most men who envy hate,
This man curies,
Therefore‚ This man (probably) hates.

The reasoning is logically faulty3 for, the major premise
not being absolutely universal, the middle term is not
distributed.

The σημεῖον will form one premise of a syllogism which
may be in any of the three figures, as in the following
examples :

Fi .l. Fi .2.
All ambitious ineu are liberal; All pregnant ivoman are pale.

Pittacus is ambitibus (Σ), This woman is pule (Σ),
Therefore, Pittacus is liberal. Therelore‚ She is pregnant

Fig. 3.
Pittacus is good (ψ,
Pittacus is wisc,
Therefore, All wisc men are good.

0 In the first and second figures, the σημεῖον is clearly the minor
premise; this alone being singular. In the third, as far as quantity is
conccmed, we may choose between both promises. It seems more natural
however to preter the major; because, in assigning a reason ior our belief
in agivcn proposition, we should naturally state a premise having either
the same predicate or the same sunjon not oue in which the predicate oi
the promise is the subject oi the conclusion. For examplc; Why do you
believe Pittacus to be liberal? Because heis ambitione. Why do yon
believe vise mentobe good? Because Pittacus is good. This is lar more
natural thantoanswer‚“BecauscPittacusiswise.” The same consideration
will furnish the data lor interpreting an obscure passage in Anal. Pr. ii. 26.
t. which however it would exceed my present limita to attempt Tbereeder
will find it rightly explained in a note tc St. Hilaire’s Translati0n‚ vol. ii.
p. 341. with the exception that the syllogism mcybe more clearly stated in
Cesarc than in Gemestres.
