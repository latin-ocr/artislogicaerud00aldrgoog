mits only a relative differentis. His defiuition of man
is ζῷον Myania imin rational being the differentia of man
when compared with brutes3 mortol, when compared with
the Gods‘. But if either of these attributes be selected
as the differentia of man absolutely, we must again heve
recourse to Realism to justify the position. If species are
made by Nature, they may have been so framed that each
has e peculias characteristic shared by no other. How
this can be proved to be the case is another question 3
but there is no ὰ priori impossibility in the supposition.
But if the species is but a conception formed by the
mind, what is to hinder us from forming four complex
notions, ahc, abd, aod, bod, of which no part is a dif-
ferentia absolutely und per se, though e distinguishes the
first from the second, b the first from the third, and a the
first from the fourth? ,
With regurd to the doctrine of the Infima Species
being the whole essenos of the individusls of which it
is predicated, the case is still eleerer; inasmuch as this
lenguage was expressly maintained by the Realists, and
expressly repudieted hythe Nominalists. It is true that
it is previously to be found iu Boethius; but here his
authority is of little value, as nothing can be more vacil- ¹
lating then his opinions on the whole question. Boethius
wrote his Commentaries with the designes reconciling
Aristotle with Plat03 he succeeded only in contradicting
himself. In one of his expositione of Porphyry he goes
beyond Pluto in Realism3 in the other, he is a professed
Conceptualistl. But even had bis views been more
definite in favour cf the latter hypothesis, it would only

shew that he admitted details into his system incon-

sistent, if pushed to their ultimate consequentes, with its
main positions.
